# Java Installation and Versioning on Amazon Linux

## Java Version Naming Explained

| Marketing Name | Actual Version | Notes                              |
| -------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Java 8         | 1.8            | 1.8 = Java 8 (older style)         |
| Java 9         | 9              | New versioning started from Java 9 |
| Java 11        | 11             | Long-Term Support (LTS) version    |
| Java 17        | 17             | LTS version                        |
| Java 21        | 21             | LTS version                        |

- **Java 1.8** = **Java 8**
- **Java 9 and onwards**: No more "1." prefix. Directly called Java 9, Java 11, Java 17, etc.

> **Important**: From Java 9 onwards, Oracle and OpenJDK switched to simple version numbering.

When you run `java -version` for Java 8, you see:

```sh
openjdk version "1.8.0_442"
```

When you run `java -version` for Java 17, you see:

```sh
openjdk version "17.0.10" 2024-01-16
```

# Java Installation Types on Amazon Linux
On Amazon Linux 2 and Amazon Linux 2023, you can install Java in different ways. However, there are some important updates for Amazon Linux 2023 users.

---

# Important Note for Amazon Linux 2023

✅ **You cannot install OpenJDK directly** via `yum` in Amazon Linux 2023 like you could in Amazon Linux 2.

Instead, **Amazon Corretto** is recommended.

- **Corretto** is a **build of OpenJDK**.
- **OpenJDK** is the **source code** that can be compiled by anyone into binary distributions.
- **Amazon Corretto** is AWS's production-ready, certified build of OpenJDK.

➡️ So, if you want to install OpenJDK on Amazon Linux 2023, **install Corretto**. It's OpenJDK under the hood, fully compatible, and better supported.

> **Fun Fact:** Corretto identifies itself as **OpenJDK** when you check the version!

Example:

```sh
java -version
```
Output:
```sh
openjdk version "17.0.10" 2024-01-16 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Corretto-17.0.10.7.1 (build 17.0.10+7-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Corretto-17.0.10.7.1 (build 17.0.10+7-LTS, mixed mode, sharing)
```

# How to Search and List Available Java Packages

You can check available Java-related packages using `yum`.

### 🔎 Search for Java Packages

```sh
yum search java
```

This will list all available Java-related packages.

### 📋 List Available Java Packages

You can also list and filter them like this:

```sh
yum list available | grep java
```

Example Output:

```sh
java-1.8.0-amazon-corretto.x86_64     1:1.8.0+382.b05-1.amzn2023     amazonlinux
java-11-amazon-corretto.x86_64         1:11.0.22+7-1.amzn2023         amazonlinux
java-17-amazon-corretto.x86_64         1:17.0.10+7-1.amzn2023         amazonlinux
java-21-amazon-corretto.x86_64         1:21.0.2+13-1.amzn2023         amazonlinux
```

As you can see, **Amazon Corretto** packages for Java 8, 11, 17, and 21 are available.

# How to Install Specific Java Versions Manually
- https://signon.oracle.com/signin
- https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
- https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/archive/

Sometimes, you might need a very specific Java version (for example Oracle JDK or a different OpenJDK build). In such cases, you can manually install Java:

When you visit the Oracle Java Archive Downloads from a Windows laptop, it asks you to sign in with an Oracle account. This is because Oracle wants to track license agreements.

### Steps for Downloading:

1. **Sign in** to your Oracle account.
2. Once logged in, start the download for the desired JDK version.
3. You can **copy the download link** directly from your browser. This link will contain a special temporary token called `AuthParam`.


`AuthParam` is temporary → it will expire after some time (minutes to hours).

### Correct Steps You Followed:

✅ Download Oracle JDK using `wget -O`:
```sh
cd /opt

sudo wget -O jdk-11.0.26_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz "https://download.oracle.com/otn/java/jdk/11.0.26+7/720377fa814b4b4491dea5837af261de/jdk-11.0.26_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz?AuthParam=1745753287_8ac92d1b378288f1fdbc319f945bfa06"
```

✅ Extract:
```sh
sudo tar -xzf jdk-11.0.26_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz
```

✅ Add to PATH:
```sh
export PATH=/opt/jdk-11.0.26/bin:$PATH
```

✅ Verify:
```sh
java -version
```

Output:
```sh
java version "11.0.26" 2025-01-21 LTS
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.26+7-LTS-187)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.26+7-LTS-187, mixed mode)
```

### Important Note ⚡
If you close the session, you will lose the export PATH change.
To make it permanent, add it to your .bashrc:

```sh
echo 'export PATH=/opt/jdk-11.0.26/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
---

### Switching Between Multiple Java Versions (Amazon Linux 2 Only)

```sh
sudo alternatives --config java
```

Choose the version you want to use.

---

### Check Installed Java Path and Environment

```sh
which java
echo $JAVA_HOME
```

---

### Uninstall Java

### For Corretto installed via yum:

```sh
sudo yum remove java-17-amazon-corretto
```

### For manually installed JDK:

```sh
sudo rm -rf /opt/jdk-11.0.26
```



# Summary Table

# Important Tips

- Always verify your installation with `java -version`.
- Set `JAVA_HOME` and update `PATH` properly if needed.
- Prefer **Amazon Corretto** for production workloads on AWS.
