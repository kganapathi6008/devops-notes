# 🍀 Amazon Linux 2023, `yum`, `dnf`, and Java Installation — Simplified

## 1. `amazon-linux-extras` and Amazon Linux 2023
- `amazon-linux-extras` **was used in Amazon Linux 2** to enable/install extra software.
- In **Amazon Linux 2023**, `amazon-linux-extras` **is gone**.
  👉 You install software **directly** from repositories using `dnf`.

---

## 2. `dnf` is the new package manager (replacing `yum`)

- `dnf` officially replaced `yum` starting with:
  - **RHEL 8+**
  - **CentOS 8+**
  - **Fedora 22+**
  - **Amazon Linux 2023**

- Why?
  - `dnf` is faster at resolving dependencies.
  - Better error handling and transaction history.
  - Cleaner, more reliable package management.

- Even though you can type `yum install ...`, **it is internally running `dnf`**.

✅ **Backward compatibility**:
You can keep using `yum` commands — no need to relearn immediately!

## 3. `yum` vs `dnf` on Amazon Linux 2023
| Feature | Amazon Linux 2 | Amazon Linux 2023 |
|:--------|:---------------|:-----------------|
| Default Package Manager | `yum` + `amazon-linux-extras` | `dnf` |
| If you type `yum`... | Normal `yum` | Internally runs `dnf` |
| `amazon-linux-extras`? | Yes | No |

✅ **In Amazon Linux 2023:**
Typing `yum` still works — but it's just a shortcut for `dnf`.
(Backward compatibility.)

---

## 4. Quick Check

To confirm that `yum` is actually `dnf` under the hood:

```bash
ls -l /usr/bin/yum
```
You should see something like:

```bash
/usr/bin/yum -> dnf
```

Or check version:

```bash
yum --version
```
It will show a `dnf` version.

# 📦 Understanding `rpm`, `yum`, and `dnf` — Simply Explained

## 1. What is `rpm`?

- `rpm` = **Red Hat Package Manager**.
- It is **both**:
  - A **file format** (`.rpm` files are software packages).
  - A **tool** (command) to install/manage `.rpm` files.

---

## 2. What is a `.rpm` file?

- A `.rpm` file is like an installer (`.exe` for Windows, `.apk` for Android).
- It contains:
  - Program files
  - Version information
  - Dependency information

Example of installing a `.rpm` manually:

```bash
sudo rpm -ivh package-name.rpm
```

---

## 3. What is `yum` and `dnf`?

- `yum` and `dnf` are **package managers**.
- They make it **easier** to install software by:
  - Finding `.rpm` files
  - Resolving dependencies
  - Using `rpm` under the hood

✅ **`dnf` is the newer and better version of `yum`** (used in RHEL 8+, CentOS 8+, Amazon Linux 2023).

Example:

```bash
sudo dnf install nginx
```

- `dnf` downloads the `.rpm`
- Installs it using `rpm`
- Also installs anything else nginx needs

## 4. Your Amazon Linux 2023 System Info

When you saw:

```bash
$ yum --version
```

```bash
4.14.0
  Installed: dnf-0:4.14.0-1.amzn2023.0.6.noarch at Fri Apr 11 00:11:28 2025
  Built    : Amazon Linux at Fri Feb  7 20:55:48 2025

  Installed: rpm-0:4.16.1.3-29.amzn2023.0.6.x86_64 at Fri Apr 11 00:11:13 2025
  Built    : Amazon Linux at Mon Feb 26 20:41:20 2024
```


It means:
- The **rpm tool** version 4.16.1.3 is installed.
- It's ready to be used under `dnf` or manually if needed.

## 5. Super Quick Summary

| Tool | Purpose |
|:-----|:--------|
| `rpm` | Low-level tool to install `.rpm` files manually |
| `yum` | Older package manager (uses `rpm` internally) |
| `dnf` | Newer package manager (faster, smarter, uses `rpm` internally) |
| `.rpm` file | A software package file |

✅ You mostly use `dnf install ...` or `yum install ...`, and they take care of `rpm` behind the scenes!
