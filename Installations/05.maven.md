# Method-1: Install Maven 3.9.9 (User-Specific Setup)

This guide explains how to install **Maven 3.9.9** on an EC2 instance where it will be available **only** for the user who updates their `.bashrc` file (e.g., `ec2-user`).

---

## Step 1: Update System and Install Required Tools

```sh
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y tar curl
```

## Step 2: Download and Extract Maven

```sh
cd /opt
sudo curl -O https://downloads.apache.org/maven/maven-3/3.9.9/binaries/apache-maven-3.9.9-bin.tar.gz
sudo tar -xzf apache-maven-3.9.9-bin.tar.gz
```

### After Extraction

Check the extracted files using `ls`:

```sh
$ ls
apache-maven-3.9.9  apache-maven-3.9.9-bin.tar.gz
```

You will see the `apache-maven-3.9.9` directory extracted in *`/opt`*.

To check if Maven is extracted properly, you can run Maven using the full path:

```sh
$ /opt/apache-maven-3.9.9/bin/mvn --version
```

Example output:

```sh
Apache Maven 3.9.9 (8e8579a9e76f7d015ee5ec7bfcdc97d260186937)
Maven home: /opt/apache-maven-3.9.9
```

> **Note:** At this point, Maven is installed, but you have to use the full path every time. To avoid that, we set environment variables next.

---

## Step 3: Set Maven in PATH for Current User Only

Edit the `.bashrc` file:

```sh
vi ~/.bashrc
```

Add the following line at the end:

```sh
export PATH=/opt/apache-maven-3.9.9/bin:$PATH
```

Apply the changes:

```sh
source ~/.bashrc
```

### What Are We Doing Here?

- We are telling Linux where to find the `mvn` command.
- Only the user who updates their `.bashrc` file (like `ec2-user`) will have Maven available.
- Other users will **not** have access to Maven unless they do the same setup.

> **Simple Explanation:**\
> "Hey Linux, whenever *I* type `mvn`, look inside `/opt/apache-maven-3.9.9/bin`!"

---

## Step 4: Verify Maven Installation

Now you can check Maven version from anywhere:

```sh
mvn -version
```

Expected output:

```sh
Apache Maven 3.9.9
... (more details)
```

---

## Summary

- Maven binaries are downloaded and extracted under `/opt/apache-maven-3.9.9/`.
- Maven is made available **only for the current user** by updating their `.bashrc` file.
- No need to type full path `/opt/apache-maven-3.9.9/bin/mvn` every time.  `mvn` command works anywhere in the shell session after setting up the environment variable.

# Method 2: Install Maven 3.9.6 (Available for **All Users**)

In this method, Maven will work for **everyone** on the system because we configure environment variables globally.

## Step 1: Download and Extract Maven
```sh
cd /opt
sudo wget https://downloads.apache.org/maven/maven-3/3.9.6/binaries/apache-maven-3.9.6-bin.tar.gz
sudo tar -xvzf apache-maven-3.9.6-bin.tar.gz
sudo ln -s /opt/apache-maven-3.9.6 /opt/maven
```
- `ln -s` creates a **symlink** `/opt/maven` pointing to `/opt/apache-maven-3.9.6`.
- Easier to update Maven versions in the future by just updating the symlink.


## Step 2: Set Maven Environment Variables Globally
```sh
echo 'export M2_HOME=/opt/maven' | sudo tee -a /etc/profile.d/maven.sh
echo 'export PATH=$M2_HOME/bin:$PATH' | sudo tee -a /etc/profile.d/maven.sh
sudo chmod +x /etc/profile.d/maven.sh
source /etc/profile.d/maven.sh
```

### What are we doing here?
- `/etc/profile.d/maven.sh` is a script that **runs for every user** when they log in.
- This ensures **all users** automatically have Maven available in their terminal sessions.

> Simple Explanation: "Hey Linux, for **anyone** who logs in, please always check inside `/opt/maven/bin` for the `mvn` command!"


## Step 3: Verify Maven Installation
```sh
mvn -version
```
Expected output:
```
Apache Maven 3.9.6
... (more details)
```

| Flexibility              | Limited to one user                        | All users can use Maven                |

# Important Notes
- **Recommended for production environments**: Use Method 2 (global setup) so any user or service can access Maven.
- **For quick setups or testing by one user**: Method 1 is fine.
- Always verify installation using `mvn -version`.
