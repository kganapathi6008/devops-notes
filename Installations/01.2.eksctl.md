# Installing and Configuring eksctl

> `Pre-requisite`: Need AWS CLI installed and configured.
### What is eksctl and Why Do We Need It?

The AWS CLI provides generic access to all AWS services, but **eksctl** is a specialized command-line tool built specifically to simplify Amazon EKS cluster creation and management.

It automates several steps including VPC creation, IAM role setup, EKS control plane provisioning, and worker node group creation. With a single command, `eksctl create cluster`, you can spin up a production-ready EKS environment in minutes.

### Install eksctl on Linux

1. **Download and extract:**

   ```bash
   curl --location "https://github.com/eksctl-io/eksctl/releases/latest/download/eksctl_$(uname -s)_amd64.tar.gz" | tar xz -C /tmp
   ```
2. **Move binary to executable path:**

   ```bash
   sudo mv /tmp/eksctl /usr/local/bin
   ```
3. **Verify installation:**

   ```bash
   eksctl version
   ```

### Install eksctl on Windows

#### Option 1: Manual Download

1. Download the latest release from [eksctl GitHub Releases](https://github.com/eksctl-io/eksctl/releases).
2. Extract the binary and add its folder to your system `PATH`.
3. Open PowerShell or Command Prompt and run:

   ```powershell
   eksctl version
   ```

#### Option 2: Install using Chocolatey (choco)

If you have Chocolatey installed, you can install eksctl easily: (Open powesrshell in administrator mode)

```powershell
choco install eksctl -y
```

Verify after installation:

```powershell
eksctl version
```

## Next Steps

* Make sure you also have `kubectl` installed.
* Use the following command to create your first EKS cluster:

  ```bash
  eksctl create cluster --name demo-cluster --region us-east-1 --nodes 2
  ```
* To delete the cluster when no longer needed:

  ```bash
  eksctl delete cluster --name demo-cluster --region us-east-1
  ```

With AWS CLI and eksctl both set up, you're ready to manage AWS infrastructure and deploy Kubernetes workloads efficiently!
