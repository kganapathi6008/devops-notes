# Docker Networking

## 1. Docker Networking Overview
Docker uses networking to allow containers to communicate with each other, the host, and external networks. There are three main types of Docker networks:

### 1.1 Bridge Network (Default)
- **Bridge network** is the default network for containers if no network is specified.
- Containers in the bridge network can communicate using their IP addresses.
- By default, they **cannot communicate using container names** — unless you create a **custom bridge network**.

#### Creating a container in the default bridge network:
```bash
# Run an Nginx container using the default bridge network
docker run -d --name nginx_default -p 8080:80 nginx
```
- **-d**: Run in detached mode
- **--name**: Assign a name to the container
- **-p 8080:80**: Map port 8080 on the host to port 80 in the container

#### Accessing the Nginx application:
- Open a browser and visit: `http://localhost:8080`

#### Inspect the default bridge network:
```bash
docker network inspect bridge
```
This shows the network's details, including connected containers and IP addresses.

### 1.2 Custom Bridge Network
- Unlike the default bridge network, containers in a **custom bridge network** can communicate using **container names**.

#### Creating a custom bridge network:
```bash
docker network create my_bridge_network
```

#### Running containers in the custom bridge network:
```bash
docker run -d --name nginx_custom --network my_bridge_network -p 8081:80 nginx
```

#### Testing container name-based communication:
1. Start a second container in the same network:
```bash
docker run -it --rm --network my_bridge_network ubuntu:latest ping nginx_custom
```
- The Ubuntu container can **ping nginx_custom** by name since they share the same custom network.

### 1.3 Host Network
- **Host network** removes the network isolation between the container and the host.
- The container uses the host's network stack directly.

#### Running Nginx using host networking:
```bash
docker run -d --name nginx_host --network host nginx
```

#### Accessing the Nginx application:
- Nginx will be available on the host’s port 80: `http://localhost:80`
- **Note**: Port mapping (`-p`) is ignored since the container shares the host's network.

### 1.4 None Network
- **None network** disables networking — the container has no access to the network.
- Useful for running isolated workloads with no network dependencies.

#### Running Nginx with no network:
```bash
docker run -d --name nginx_none --network none nginx
```

## 2. Managing Docker Networks

### 2.1 Listing Networks
To see all networks:
```bash
docker network ls
```

### 2.2 Inspecting Networks
To view details of a specific network:
```bash
docker network inspect <network_name>
```
Example (default bridge network):
```bash
docker network inspect bridge
```

### 2.3 Connecting and Disconnecting Networks
- **Connect a running container to a network**:
```bash
docker network connect my_bridge_network nginx_default
```
- **Disconnect a container from a network**:
```bash
docker network disconnect my_bridge_network nginx_default
```

## 3. Accessing Applications in Different Networks

| Network Type    | Access Method                     | Container-to-Container Communication |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Bridge (default)| `http://localhost:<mapped_port>`   | **By IP** only                      |
| Custom Bridge   | `http://localhost:<mapped_port>`   | **By container name** or IP         |
| Host            | `http://localhost:<container_port>`| Uses host’s network directly        |
| None            | Not accessible                    | No networking available             |

## 4. Summary
- Use **default bridge** for simple networking.
- Use **custom bridge** to allow containers to communicate via names.
- Use **host network** for high-performance networking when container isolation isn’t needed.
- Use **none network** to completely disable networking.
- **Inspect networks** to view configurations and connected containers.
