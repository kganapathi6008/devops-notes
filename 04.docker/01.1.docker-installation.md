# Docker

## Introduction
In modern software development, the need to run multiple operating systems (OS) on a single machine led to the creation of **Virtual Machines (VMs)**. However, VMs come with certain limitations, such as being resource-heavy and slow to bootstrap. This is where **Docker** and **containerization** come into play. Let's break it down step by step.

---

## 1. Why Do We Need Docker?

### The Problem with Traditional Virtual Machines
- In a single machine, running multiple operating systems was made possible by **Virtual Machines (VMs)**.
- A **Virtual Machine (VM)** contains:
  - **Guest Operating System**
  - Libraries and Binaries
  - Application Files
- When deploying applications on EC2 instances (or other cloud VMs):
  - You have to select an **AMI (Amazon Machine Image)**.
  - Define **capacity** (CPU, RAM, etc.).
  - Configure **Networking** (VPC, Subnets, Security Groups, Public IP).
  - Allocate **Static Memory**.

### Inefficiencies of VMs
- If your application uses only **100MB RAM**, but the minimum available instance type has **1GB RAM**, you are forced to over-allocate resources.
- **Boot time:** Starting a VM takes about **2-3 minutes**.
- **Autoscaling:** When VMs are used in autoscaling, spinning up new instances takes time (2-3 minutes per instance), slowing down the ability to quickly replicate services.
- **Complex networking:** Explicit configurations are needed for VPC, subnets, security groups, and public IPs.

---

## 2. The Need for a Lightweight Solution
To solve these problems, we need:
- **Lightweight images**
- **Dynamic memory allocation**
- **Faster bootstrap times** (start containers in seconds)
- **Simpler networking**

---

## 3. Virtualization vs. Containerization
### Virtualization (VMs)
- Virtualizes **hardware**.
- Each VM has its own **Guest OS**.
- Heavyweight and slow to start.
- Example: Running multiple EC2 instances, each with its own OS.

### Containerization
- Virtualizes the **Operating System** (OS-level virtualization).
- No Guest OS â€” shares the Host OS kernel.
- Only contains necessary **binaries, libraries, and application code**.
- Lightweight and starts in **seconds**.
- Provides process-level isolation.

---

## 4. Introduction to Docker
Docker is a popular **containerization platform** that solves the inefficiencies of VMs by enabling lightweight, portable, and fast containers.

---

## 5. Docker Architecture
Docker uses a **Client-Server Architecture**:

1. **Docker Client**
   - Interacts with the Docker Daemon.
   - Runs `docker` commands (e.g., `docker run`, `docker build`).

2. **Docker Host (Daemon)**
   - Runs the Docker engine.
   - Manages images, containers, networks, and volumes.

3. **Docker Registry**
   - Stores Docker images.
   - Public registry: **Docker Hub**.
   - Private registries can also be set up.

4. **Docker Images**
   - Read-only templates to create containers.
   - Example: An image containing a Java runtime, Spring Boot app, and necessary dependencies.

5. **Docker Containers**
   - Lightweight, runnable instances of Docker images.
   - Start, stop, and replicate in **seconds**.

6. **Dockerfile**
   - A text file with instructions to build Docker images.
   - Defines the base image, app dependencies, and startup commands.

## 6. Why Docker over VMs?
| Feature              | Virtual Machines (VMs)       | Docker Containers        |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|
| **OS**               | Guest OS for each VM        | Shares host OS kernel   |
| **Boot Time**        | Minutes                     | Seconds                 |
| **Size**             | GBs (includes OS)           | MBs (only app + deps)   |
| **Resource Allocation** | Static                     | Dynamic                 |
| **Networking**       | Complex                     | Simple                  |

## 7. Practical Use Case: Microservices
### What are Microservices?
Microservices are an architectural style where an application is divided into small, independent services. Each service runs in its own container.

### Example:
- **Account Service**: Manages user accounts.
- **Inventory Service**: Manages product inventory.
- **Shipping Service**: Manages order shipping.

### Benefits:
- **Loosely Coupled**: Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
- **Fault Isolation**: Failure in one service does not affect others.
- **Scalability**: Individual services can be scaled based on demand.

---

## 8. Creating an EC2 Instance with Docker
When creating an EC2 instance:
1. **Select AMI**: Choose a lightweight AMI (Amazon Machine Image).
2. **Capacity**: Allocate resources dynamically.
3. **Networking**: Configure VPC, subnets, and security groups.
4. **Install Docker**: On top of the EC2 instance, install Docker to run containers.

### Why Use Docker on EC2?
- Avoid the overhead of a Guest OS.
- Faster deployment and scaling of applications.

---

## 9. Summary
- **VMs** are heavyweight and slow to bootstrap.
- **Containers** are lightweight, fast, and efficient.
- **Docker** is the leading platform for containerization.
- **Microservices** benefit greatly from containerization.
- Use Docker on EC2 for efficient resource utilization and faster scaling.

# Docker Installation on Amazon Linux 2

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing Docker on an Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance.

## Prerequisites
- An Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance.
- SSH access to the instance.
- Sudo privileges.

## Steps to Install Docker

### 1. Connect to the EC2 Instance
Use SSH to connect to your Amazon Linux 2 instance:
```sh
ssh ec2-user@<ec2-ip-address-dns-name-here>
```

### 2. Update the System Packages
Before installing Docker, update the existing packages:
```sh
sudo yum update -y
```

### 3. Search for Docker Package (Optional)
To check if Docker is available in the repository, run:
```sh
sudo yum search docker
```

To get more information about the Docker package:
```sh
sudo yum info docker
```

### 4. Install Docker
Run the following command to install Docker:
```sh
sudo yum install docker -y
```

### 5. Enable Docker to Start on Boot
Enable the Docker service so it starts automatically upon system reboot:
```sh
sudo systemctl enable docker.service
```

### 6. Start the Docker Service
Start the Docker service manually:
```sh
sudo systemctl start docker.service
```

### 7. Verify Docker Status
Check if Docker is running properly:
```sh
sudo systemctl status docker.service
```

### 8. Add User to Docker Group
By default, Docker requires root or sudo privileges. To allow the `ec2-user` to run Docker commands without `sudo`, add the user to the `docker` group:
```sh
sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user
```

### 9. Logout and Login Again
For the changes to take effect, log out and log back into the instance:
```sh
exit
```
Then reconnect using SSH:
```sh
ssh ec2-user@<ec2-ip-address-dns-name-here>
```

### 10. Apply Group Changes Without Logging Out
Instead of logging out and logging back in, you can apply the group changes immediately using:
```sh
newgrp docker
```
This will start a new shell session with the updated group permissions.

### 11. Verify Docker Access
Run the following command to check if you can use Docker without `sudo`:
```sh
docker ps
```
If the command runs successfully without requiring `sudo`, the setup is complete.


```sh
docker version
```
```sh
docker info
```
To test Docker, run the `hello-world` container:
```sh
docker run hello-world
```

# Docker Commands

## 1. Checking Docker Processes

To check if Docker is running on Linux:
```bash
systemctl status docker
```
Or:
```bash
ps aux | grep docker
```

## 2. Docker Images

### Default Docker Registry
By default, Docker uses **Docker Hub** as its default registry. To check the current registry:
```bash
docker info | grep Registry
```

### Pulling Sample Images from Docker Registry
To pull an image from Docker Hub:
```bash
docker pull ubuntu
```
Example:
```bash
docker pull nginx
```

### Listing Docker Images
- List all images:
```bash
docker images
```
- Alternative command:
```bash
docker image ls
```
- List only image IDs:
```bash
docker images -q
```

### Deleting Docker Images
- Remove a specific image:
```bash
docker rmi <image_id>
```
- Remove all images:
```bash
docker rmi $(docker images -q)
```

### Tagging and Pushing Images to DockerHub
- Tag an image:
```bash
docker tag <image_id> your_dockerhub_username/your_image_name:tag
```
- Push the image to DockerHub:
```bash
docker push your_dockerhub_username/your_image_name:tag
```

## 3. Docker Containers

### Running Docker Containers as Jobs (One-time commands)
Run a command inside a container and exit:
```bash
docker run -it ubuntu cat /etc/os-release
```
Another example (prints current directory):
```bash
docker run -it ubuntu pwd
```

### Running Docker Containers as Services (Background process)
To run a service (detached mode):
```bash
docker run -d nginx
```
- `-d`: Detached mode, runs the container in the background.
- Used for long-running services like web servers.

### Checking Running Containers
- List running containers:
```bash
docker ps
```
- List all containers (running and stopped):
```bash
docker ps -a
```
- List only container IDs:
```bash
docker ps -aq
```

### Running and Accessing Docker Containers
- Interactive shell inside Ubuntu container:
```bash
docker run -it ubuntu bash
```
- Detached mode (runs in the background):
```bash
docker run -itd ubuntu
```
Difference:
- `-it`: Interactive shell.
- `-d`: Detached mode (background process).

### Accessing a Running Container
To go inside a running container:
1. List running containers:
```bash
docker ps
```
2. Access a specific container (replace `container_id` with your container's ID):
```bash
docker exec -it ubuntu bash
```
Example: Installing Java inside an Ubuntu container:
```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install default-jdk
```

### Creating an Image from Container Changes
After making changes inside a container, create a new image:
```bash
docker commit <container_id> new_image_name
```
Example:
```bash
docker commit 123abc my_ubuntu_with_java
```

### Stopping and Removing Containers
- Stop a running container:
```bash
docker stop <container_id>
```
- Stop all running containers:
```bash
docker stop $(docker ps -q)
```
- Remove a container:
```bash
docker rm <container_id>
```
- Remove all containers:
```bash
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
```

### Renaming a Container
Rename an existing container:
```bash
docker rename <old_name> <new_name>
```

### Checking Container Logs
To view logs of a running container:
```bash
docker logs <container_id>
```

### Running and Configuring Nginx Container
- Run an Nginx container:
```bash
docker run -d --name my_nginx -p 8080:80 nginx
```
- `--name my_nginx`: Assigns a name to the container.
- `-p 8080:80`: Maps port 8080 on your machine to port 80 in the container.

## 4. DockerHub and AWS ECR

### DockerHub Authentication
- Login to DockerHub:
```bash
docker login
```

### Working with AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
- Login to ECR (requires AWS CLI configured):
```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region <your-region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com
```
- Tag an image for ECR:
```bash
docker tag <image_id> <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/your_repository:tag
```
- Push the image to ECR:
```bash
docker push <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/your_repository:tag
```

### Using IAM Roles for ECR Authentication
- Attach an IAM role to the EC2 instance.
- Verify authentication:
```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

### ECR Image Retention Policy
Set up a retention policy for ECR images to automatically remove old images:
1. Go to ECR in the AWS console.
2. Select your repository.
3. Configure the **Image Tag Mutability** and **Lifecycle Policy** to auto-delete images after a certain period.
