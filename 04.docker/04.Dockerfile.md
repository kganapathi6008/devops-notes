# Dockerfile Basics

## 1. What is a Dockerfile?
- A **Dockerfile** is a script containing a set of instructions to **build** a Docker image. It defines everything needed for an application, such as base images, dependencies, environment variables, and commands to run. Docker Daemon runs will process the instructions from top to bottom.
- When you run the docker build command, the Docker daemon reads the Dockerfile line by line and executes each instruction in sequence.

---

## 2. Common Dockerfile Instructions
Here are the essential instructions used in a Dockerfile:

### **1. FROM** (Base Image)
```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
```
Defines the base image for the container. Every Dockerfile must start with a `FROM` instruction.

### **2. LABEL** (Metadata)
```dockerfile
LABEL maintainer="Ganapathi"
```
Adds metadata like author or version information.

### **3. RUN** (Execute Commands)
```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl
```
Executes commands inside the container during the image build process.
**Usecase:** To install softwares while creating the image.

### **4. WORKDIR** (Set Working Directory)
```dockerfile
WORKDIR /app
```
Sets the working directory for subsequent commands like `COPY`, `RUN`, and `CMD`.

### **5. COPY** (Copy Files from Host to Container)
```dockerfile
COPY app.py /app/
```
Copies files from the local system to the container.

### **6. ADD** (Copy with URL & Extraction Support)
```dockerfile
ADD myfile.tar.gz /app/
```
Similar to `COPY`, but also supports downloading from URLs and auto-extracting archives.

### **7. ENV** (Set Environment Variables)
```dockerfile
ENV PORT=8080
```
   - Defines environment variables that can be used within the container.
   - At Runtime: You can override ENV but ARG is no longer available.

### **8. EXPOSE** (Inform about Container Ports)
```dockerfile
EXPOSE $PORT
```
Indicates that the container will listen on a specific port (does not map ports).

### **9. CMD** (Default Command to Run)
```dockerfile
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```
Defines the **default command** to execute when the container starts.
**Usecase:** To start the application process while starting the container.

### **10. ENTRYPOINT** (Main Process for the Container)
```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["python"]
CMD ["app.py"]
```
Used to specify the main application, allowing extra arguments to be passed.

### **11. VOLUME** (Persistent Storage)
```dockerfile
VOLUME /data
```
Defines a mount point for external volumes.

### **12. ARG** (Build-Time Variables)
```dockerfile
ARG VERSION=1.0
```
   - Used to pass variables during the build process.
   - **During Build**: You can override ARG but not ENV

### **13. HEALTHCHECK** (Container Health Monitoring)
```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK CMD curl --fail http://localhost:$PORT || exit 1
```
Defines a health check command to monitor container status.

### **14. USER** (Set User for Execution)
```dockerfile
USER nonrootuser
```
Defines which user should run inside the container.


---

## 3. Example Dockerfile
```dockerfile
# Use official Python image
FROM python:3.9

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy application files
COPY . /app/

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set environment variable
ENV PORT=5000

# Expose port
EXPOSE $PORT

# Default command to run the app
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

---

## 4. Using Environment Variables in the Application
### **Accessing ENV Variables in a Python Application**
The `ENV` variable defined in the Dockerfile can be accessed in the application code as follows:

```python
import os

# Get the PORT value from the environment variable, default to 6000 if not set
port = os.getenv("PORT", "6000")
print(f"App running on port {port}")
```

This allows the application to dynamically use the port defined in the Dockerfile

### **Overriding Environment Variables at Runtime**
You can override the `PORT` value when running the container:
```sh
docker run -d -p 9090:9090 -e PORT=9090 myapp:latest
```
This sets `PORT=9090` inside the container, which the application will read and use.

---

## 5. Setting Environment Variables in a Server (Non-Docker)
If you want to test the application outside of Docker, you need to manually set the environment variable in your server shell:

### **1. Checking if PORT is set**
```sh
echo $PORT
```
If this returns nothing, the variable is not set.

### **2. Temporarily Setting PORT (for current shell only)**
```sh
PORT=5000

python3 app.py          # This will not be available to child processes
```
This will not persist if you start a new shell session, and `PORT` is **not available to child processes**.

### **3. Setting PORT for All Processes (for current session)**
```sh
export PORT=5000
python3 app.py
```
Using `export` ensures that the variable is inherited by **child processes**, including Python scripts.

### **4. Making the Variable Persistent Across Reboots**
To keep `PORT=5000` even after restarting the server, add it to the shell profile:

#### **For Bash Users** (Most Common)
```sh
echo "export PORT=5000" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now, `PORT=5000` will be available whenever you start a new session or reboot the system.

---

## 6. Building and Running a Docker Image
### **1. Build the Image**
```sh
## syntax: docker build -t <ApplicationName>:<tag> <DockerBuildContext>
docker build -t myapp:latest .
```

- `docker build`: Builds a new Docker image.
- `-t myapp:latest`: Tags the image with the name myapp and the tag latest. This makes it easier to reference later.
- `.`: Specifies the **build context**, which is the directory containing the `Dockerfile` and all required files. Docker will use this directory to find and copy necessary files into the image during the build process.

If you are in /home/user/myapp, running `docker build -t myapp:latest .` will set /home/user/myapp as the build context. This will use /path/to/app instead of the current directory.

```bash
docker build -t myapp:latest /path/to/app
```

If you are using custome name for Dockerfile, then you have use `-f <custom_Dockerfile_name>` option.

```bash
docker build -t myapp:latest -f <custom_Dockerfile_name> /path/to/app
```
If you want the build process withot cache, then you have use `--no-cache` option.

```bash
docker build --no-cache -t myapp:latest .
```
### **2. Run the Container**
```sh
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 myapp:latest
```
- `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
- `-p 5000:5000`: Maps port **5000** on the host to port **5000** inside the container.
- `myapp:latest`: Specifies the image name and tag to use.

This will create and start a container from the built image!

---

## 7. Best Practices
- Use **official base images** when possible.
- Minimize the number of `RUN` layers to optimize image size.
- Use `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files.
- Prefer `COPY` over `ADD` unless you need automatic extraction.
- Use `ENTRYPOINT` for fixed commands and `CMD` for default arguments.
- Regularly **scan** images for vulnerabilities.

## Simple Shell Script to Copy a Folder
If you need to copy a folder from one location to another, you can use a simple shell script:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
SOURCE_DIR="/home/ec2-user/myapp/"
DEST_DIR="/tmp/"
cp -r "$SOURCE_DIR" "$DEST_DIR"
echo "Folder copied successfully from $SOURCE_DIR to $DEST_DIR"
```

### **How to Use:**
1. **Create the script:**
   ```sh
   vi copy-folder.sh
   ```
2. **Paste the script and save (`Esc` → `:wq`)**
3. **Give execute permission:**
   ```sh
   chmod +x copy-folder.sh
   ```
4. **Run the script:**
   ```sh
   bash copy-folder.sh
   ```

# CMD vs ENTRYPOINT in Docker

## 1. Understanding CMD and ENTRYPOINT
CMD and ENTRYPOINT are used to define the default command that runs when a Docker container starts. However, they have different behaviors in terms of flexibility and overriding capabilities.

### **CMD (Command)**
- Provides default arguments for the container's execution.
- Can be overridden when running the container.
- Typically used to provide a default behavior but allows users to override it easily.

### **ENTRYPOINT**
- Defines a fixed command that **cannot be overridden** using `docker run`.
- Used when a container should always run a specific executable.
- Arguments provided in `docker run` are passed as parameters to ENTRYPOINT.

---

## 2. Defining CMD and ENTRYPOINT in Dockerfile
Both CMD and ENTRYPOINT can be defined in two forms:

### **Shell Form**
- The command is executed using `/bin/sh -c`.
- Example:

```dockerfile
##Syntax
CMD command param1 param2   # Shell form
ENTRYPOINT command param1 param2   # Shell form
```

```dockerfile
CMD java -jar app.jar
ENTRYPOINT java -jar app.jar
```

- Internally, it runs as:
```bash
/bin/sh -c "java -jar app.jar"
```
- This means the shell (`sh`) is the **main process**, and `java` runs as a child process.

### **Executable Form**
- The command is executed directly without a shell.
- Example:

```dockerfile
##Syntax
CMD ["executable", "param1", "param2"]          # JSON format
ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "param1", "param2"]   # JSON format (recommended)
```

```dockerfile
CMD ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```

- Internally, it runs as:
```bash
/bin/java -jar app.jar
```
- Here, `java` itself is the **main process** inside the container.

---

## 3. Execution Order of CMD and ENTRYPOINT

- If both are present, ENTRYPOINT is executed first, and CMD acts as its argument.


### **Can we have multiple CMDs in Dockerfile?**
- No, only the **last CMD** in the Dockerfile is executed.

**Example**:

```dockerfile
CMD echo "Hello"
CMD echo "World"
```
- The second CMD (`echo "World"`) will override the first one.


### 1️⃣ Use Case - CMD vs ENTRYPOINT example

### **Example 1: CMD with Override**
```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
CMD ["echo", "Hello!!" ]
```
Running:
```bash
docker run cmd-ubuntu:latest date
```
**Output:**
```bash
Sat Mar 23 12:00:00 UTC 2025  # The current date/time, because CMD is overridden
```
Since `CMD` acts as default arguments, `date` replaces `echo Hello!!` at runtime.

### **Example 2: ENTRYPOINT with Override**
```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
ENTRYPOINT ["echo", "Hello!!" ]
```
Running:
```bash
docker run entrypoint-ubuntu:latest date
```
**Output:**
```bash
Hello!! date  # ENTRYPOINT is not overridden, so "date" is treated as an argument
```

### **Example 3: CMD + ENTRYPOINT Together**
```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
CMD ["ls", "/"]
ENTRYPOINT ["echo", "Hello!!"]
```
Running:
```bash
docker run entrypoint-cmd-ubuntu:latest
```
**Output:**
```bash
Hello!! ls /  # CMD is passed as arguments to ENTRYPOINT
```
Since `ENTRYPOINT` is set to `echo Hello!!`, CMD (`ls /`) is appended as an argument.

### **Conclusion**
- If you override **only `CMD`**, the original `ENTRYPOINT` still runs.
- If you override **`ENTRYPOINT`**, the original `CMD` is ignored unless explicitly passed (`exec "$@"`).
- If you want both custom logic **and** to keep the original behavior, modify `ENTRYPOINT` to execute `"$@"` properly.


### 2️⃣ Use Case - Java example
You have a Java application `app.jar` that normally runs using:
```bash
java -jar app.jar
```

#### **Using CMD** --> ✅ Can be overridden:
```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:11
COPY app.jar /app.jar
CMD ["java", "-jar", "/app.jar"]
```

```bash
docker run my-java-app:latest java -jar anotherapp.jar   ## This will override the CMD in the Dockerfile
```

#### **Using ENTRYPOINT**  --> ❌ Cannot overridden untill you specify the `--entrypoint`.
```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:11
COPY app.jar /app.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app.jar"]
```

```bash
docker run my-java-app:latest java -jar anotherapp.jar   ## this will not work
```
Running as:
```bash
java -jar /app.jar java -jar anotherapp.jar
```
As the arguments are already defined in ENTRYPOINT, resulting in `java -jar /app.jar java -jar anotherapp.jar`. This is incorrect and will likely cause an error.

```bash
docker run --entrypoint java my-java-app:latest -jar anotherapp.jar        ## This will work, because we explicitly mentioned --entrypoint java
```

#### **Using both ENTRYPOINT and CMD** --> ✅ **Overriding Default Port in Java Application**

```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:11
COPY app.jar /app.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app.jar"]
CMD ["--server.port=8080"]
```
- ENTRYPOINT is fixed (java -jar /app.jar).
- CMD is just arguments (--server.port=8080).

1. If your Spring Boot app runs on port 8080 by default:
   ```bash
   docker run my-java-app:latest
   ```
      It is going to work like this
   ```bash
   java -jar app.jar --server.port=8080
   ```

2. To run container with a different port:
   ```bash
   docker run my-java-app:latest --server.port=8082
   ```
   Here we change the port dynamically:
   ```bash
   java -jar app.jar --server.port=8082
   ```
### 3️⃣ Use Case - Python example
You have a Python application `app.py` that normally runs using:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app/
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
EXPOSE 5000

ENTRYPOINT ["python"]
CMD ["app.py"]
```
- Running without args, `docker run my-container`, and it will execute like this:
```bash
python app.py
```
- Running with args, `docker run my-container script.py`, it will execute:
```bash
python script.py     ## here 'script.py' will be executed instead of 'app.py'
```
---
## 4. Problem: Database Connection Handling in Shell Form
### **Issue:**
```dockerfile
CMD java -jar app.jar
```
- When stopping a container, `sh` (the parent process) gets killed, but `java` (child process) does not receive the termination signal.
- This leads to database connections not being released properly.
- The database connection pool remains open, leading to potential connection exhaustion and performance degradation over time.
- If the container is restarted frequently, the database may have too many stale or orphaned connections, causing availability issues.

### **Why Does This Happen?**
- In the shell form, the main process inside the container is `sh`, which acts as a wrapper around `java -jar app.jar`.
- When the container stops, `sh` receives the termination signal (`SIGTERM`), but it **does not forward it to the child process (`java`)**.
- As a result, `java` continues running, keeping database connections alive until forcibly killed.

### **Solution:**
- Use **executable form** to make `java` the main process:

   ```dockerfile
   CMD ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
   ```

- Now, when stopping the container, `java` receives the termination signal (`SIGTERM`) directly and can close database connections cleanly.
- The application should handle termination signals properly:
  - Implement a shutdown hook in Java:

      ```java
      Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("Shutting down application...");
            closeDatabaseConnections();
      }));
      ```
  - This ensures that when `SIGTERM` is received, the database connections are properly closed before the container exits.

### **Advantages of Using Executable Form for Database Connection Handling:**
- Ensures the application process (`java`) receives termination signals properly.
- Prevents orphaned database connections and resource leakage.
- Allows graceful shutdown of the application, improving reliability and performance.

---

## 5. Conclusion
- **CMD provides a default command but is overrideable.**
- **ENTRYPOINT enforces a fixed command.**
- **Executable form is preferred** for better process handling.
- **Shell form should be avoided** unless shell features are needed.
- **Always consider proper signal handling** when designing Docker containers.
- **Using the executable form prevents database connection issues** by ensuring proper termination signal handling.


By following these best practices, we can ensure that containers handle processes, signals, and resource cleanup efficiently.

# Understanding CMD and ENTRYPOINT in Nginx Dockerfile

## 1. Overview
When using a base image like `nginx:alpine`, it already has predefined CMD and ENTRYPOINT instructions. Understanding how these interact when overridden is crucial for controlling container behavior.

## 2. Default CMD and ENTRYPOINT in `nginx:alpine`
The official `nginx:alpine` image contains the following instructions:

```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["/docker-entrypoint.sh"]
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

- **ENTRYPOINT:** `/docker-entrypoint.sh` is a script that prepares Nginx configurations before starting the server.
- **CMD:** The default command to start Nginx in the foreground (`nginx -g "daemon off;"`).

When a container starts, it executes:
  ```bash
  /docker-entrypoint.sh nginx -g "daemon off;"
  ```
  - This ensures that Nginx starts correctly and keeps running.

## 3. What Happens When You Override CMD?
If you define a CMD like this:

```dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo 'Custom CMD'"]
```

- When the container starts, instead of running Nginx, it will execute:
  ```bash
  /docker-entrypoint.sh /bin/sh -c "echo 'Custom CMD'"
  ```
- This means:
  - The container **prints 'Custom CMD'** to the logs.
  - Then **it exits immediately**, since no long-running process keeps it alive.
  - **Nginx does not start** because the original CMD (`nginx -g "daemon off;"`) was replaced.

## 4. Overriding ENTRYPOINT Instead of CMD
If you change ENTRYPOINT instead of CMD:

```dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
EXPOSE 80
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo 'Custom EntryPoint'"]
```

- This completely replaces the default `ENTRYPOINT` from the Nginx image.
- When you run the container:
  ```bash
  docker run my-nginx
  ```
  - It executes:
    ```bash
    /bin/sh -c "echo 'Custom EntryPoint'"
    ```
  - The container **prints 'Custom EntryPoint'** and then **exits**.
  - Again, **Nginx never starts.**

### **Why is CMD Ignored Here?**
1. Since `ENTRYPOINT` **was completely replaced**, the original `CMD` (`nginx -g "daemon off;"`) is **ignored**.
2. **CMD is only used if ENTRYPOINT accepts arguments** (`"$@"` in shell syntax).
3. In our overridden `ENTRYPOINT`, there is no `exec "$@"`, so CMD is **not passed** to the container.

As a result, the container **only prints 'Custom EntryPoint' and exits**, and **Nginx does not start.**


## 5. Combining CMD and ENTRYPOINT
If both CMD and ENTRYPOINT are used:

### **Option 1: Pass the Nginx command in CMD**

Modify your Dockerfile like this:

```dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
EXPOSE 80
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo 'Custom EntryPoint' && exec \"$@\""]
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

#### **How It Works:**

- The `ENTRYPOINT` prints `'Custom EntryPoint'` and then executes whatever is passed as arguments (`exec "$@"`).
- Since CMD is `["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]`, it will be passed as arguments to ENTRYPOINT and executed.

#### **Execution inside container:**

```bash
/bin/sh -c "echo 'Custom EntryPoint' && exec nginx -g 'daemon off;'"
```

### **Option 2: Override CMD at Runtime**

If your Dockerfile has:

```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo 'Custom EntryPoint'"]
```

Then you must explicitly provide the Nginx command when running the container:

```bash
docker run my-nginx-container nginx -g 'daemon off;'
```

#### **Execution inside container:**

```bash
/bin/sh -c "echo 'Custom EntryPoint'"
nginx -g 'daemon off;'
```

## 6. Best Practices for Running Nginx
To keep Nginx running, **never replace its CMD with a command that exits immediately.**

### **Correct Approach (Keeping Nginx Running)**
```dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

- This ensures Nginx starts and keeps the container running.
- If customization is needed, use `ENTRYPOINT` carefully without overriding Nginx’s behavior.


By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your Nginx container behaves as expected and does not exit prematurely.
