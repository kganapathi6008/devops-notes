# Kubernetes Pod Overview
- https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/

## **What is a Kubernetes Pod?**
A **Pod** is the smallest and most basic deployable unit in Kubernetes. It represents a single instance of a running process in a cluster and can contain one or more containers that share the same storage and network resources.

### **Key Characteristics of a Pod:**
- A Pod encapsulates one or more **containers**.
- Containers inside a Pod share **network** (same IP address and port space).
- They can **communicate** with each other using `localhost`.
- A Pod can **store data** using shared storage volumes.

## **Pod vs. Container**
| Feature             | Container | Pod (Kubernetes) |
|--------------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Definition        | A lightweight, standalone executable package that contains everything needed to run a piece of software. | A Kubernetes abstraction that can host one or more containers, providing network and storage sharing. |
| Lifecycle         | Managed by Docker or another container runtime. | Managed by Kubernetes. |
| Network          | Each container has its own network namespace. | All containers in a Pod share the same network namespace (same IP address). |
| Storage         | Can mount volumes inside the container. | Uses Kubernetes Volumes for persistent storage across all containers in a Pod. |
| Scaling         | Containers are individually managed. | Pods are managed as a unit, and Kubernetes scales them. |

## **Ways to Create a Kubernetes Pod**
There are multiple ways to create a Pod in Kubernetes:

1. **Declarative Approach: Using a YAML Manifest File** (Recommended)
   - Define a Pod specification in a YAML file and apply it using `kubectl apply -f pod.yaml`.

2. **Imperative Approach: Using `kubectl run` Command** (Quick Testing)
   - Example:
   ```bash
   kubectl run my-pod --image=nginx --port=80 --restart=Never
   ```

   ```bash
   kubectl run my-pod --image=nginx --port=80 --labels=app=my-app --restart=Never --overrides='{"spec": {"containers": [{"name": "my-container", "image": "nginx", "ports": [{"containerPort": 80}]}]}}'
   ```

## **YAML Structure of a Pod**
A **Pod definition** is written in YAML format and describes its specifications. Below is an example of a simple Pod definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
  labels:
    app: my-app
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

### **Explanation:**
- `apiVersion: v1` → Specifies the API version.
- `kind: Pod` → Defines the resource type.
- `metadata:` → Contains information about the Pod (name, labels, etc.).
- `spec:` → Specifies the desired state of the Pod.
- `containers:` → Defines the list of containers inside the Pod.
  - `name:` → The name of the container.
  - `image:` → The container image (e.g., `nginx`).
  - `ports:` → The port exposed by the container.

## **Validating YAML Before Applying**
Before applying Kubernetes YAML files, we can use the `--dry-run=client` flag to validate them.

### **Example Command:**
```sh
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml --dry-run=client
```
**Example Output:**
```
pod/my-pod created (dry run)
```
- The **dry run** mode simulates applying the YAML file **without actually creating resources**.
- The **client-side validation** ensures the YAML file is correctly formatted and can be applied successfully.

---

## **Example: Multi-Container Pod**
A Pod can contain multiple containers, for example, an application container and a sidecar container for logging.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: multi-container-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app-container
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
  - name: log-collector
    image: alpine
    command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "while true; do echo hello; sleep 10; done"]
    ports:
    - containerPort: 5000
```
### **How Do Containers Communicate in a Pod?**
- Containers in the same Pod share the **same network namespace** (same IP address).
- They can communicate with each other using **`localhost:<port>`**.
- If `app-container` runs on port `80`, `log-collector` can access it using:
  ```sh
  curl http://localhost:80
  ```
- If `log-collector` runs on port `5000`, `app-container` can access it using:
  ```sh
  curl http://localhost:5000
  ```
- Each container must use a **different port** if they expose services.

### **Use Cases for Multi-Container Pods:**
- **Sidecar Pattern**: A helper container runs alongside the main application (e.g., log collector, proxy, etc.).
- **Init Containers**: Special containers that run before the main containers start, used for setup tasks.

## **Why Do We Need Controllers in Kubernetes?**
While Pods are the fundamental unit of execution in Kubernetes, they have some limitations:

- **Pods are ephemeral**: If a Pod crashes, it does not restart automatically unless managed by a higher-level resource.
- **Scaling is manual**: To scale an application, you would need to manually create multiple Pod definitions.
- **Rolling updates are difficult**: If you need to update a Pod, you must delete and recreate it manually.

To solve these challenges, Kubernetes provides higher-level controllers that automate scaling, self-healing, rolling updates, and management of Pods.

### **List of Kubernetes Controllers**

1. **ReplicationController (RC)**
2. **ReplicaSet (RS)**
3. **Deployment**
4. **StatefulSet**
5. **DaemonSet**
6. **Job**
7. **CronJob**
8. **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**
9. **Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)**
10. **Node Controller**

By using these controllers, Kubernetes provides automated scaling, self-healing, and zero-downtime deployments, making application management much easier.

### **1. Check Kubernetes API Resources**
Run the following command to list all available API resources and their versions:

```sh
kubectl api-resources
```

This command displays all resources and their corresponding API versions, showing that `Pod` belongs to `apiVersion: v1`.

### **2. Describe a Pod**
If a Pod is already created, you can check its API version using:

```sh
kubectl get pod my-pod -o yaml
```

This will output the complete YAML definition of the Pod, including the `apiVersion` field.

### **3. Check Kubernetes API Versions**
To see all available API versions in your cluster, run:

```sh
kubectl api-versions
```

This lists all API versions available in the cluster, confirming that `v1` is used for core resources like Pods.

---

## **Conclusion**
- Pods are the fundamental unit of deployment in Kubernetes.
- They can contain one or multiple containers that share network and storage.
- YAML files define Pod specifications for Kubernetes to manage them.
- Multi-container Pods are useful for sidecar and helper container patterns.
- Kubernetes controllers like Deployments, ReplicaSets, and StatefulSets ensure automated scaling, self-healing, and simplified management of applications.
- You can determine the API version of a Pod using `kubectl api-resources`, `kubectl get pod -o yaml`, or `kubectl api-versions`.

By understanding Pods and their limitations, you can effectively utilize Kubernetes to deploy and manage applications at scale.
