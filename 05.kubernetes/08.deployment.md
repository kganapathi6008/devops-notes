## **What is a Deployment?**
A **Deployment** in Kubernetes is a higher-level abstraction that manages ReplicaSets and provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets. It allows you to:

- Deploy a specified number of pod replicas.
- Automatically replace failed or unhealthy pods.
- Perform **rolling updates** and **rollbacks**.
- Scale applications easily.

> In short, **Deployment** = ReplicaSet + Rolling Updates + Rollbacks + History + Easy Scaling

---

## **Why Deployment Came When We Already Had ReplicaSet?**
While ReplicaSets ensure that the desired number of identical pods are running, they don't support features like **rolling updates** or **rollbacks** out of the box. Managing updates manually with ReplicaSets can be error-prone.

### **Deployment Adds Key Capabilities:**
- **Declarative Updates:** Specify what you want and Kubernetes figures out how to get there.
- **Rolling Updates:** Update pods gradually without downtime.
- **Rollbacks:** Easily revert to previous versions if something goes wrong.
- **Version History:** Keeps track of deployment revisions.
- **Strategy Management:** Choose how updates are rolled out.

Hence, Deployments are used as the standard for managing stateless applications.

---

## **How Deployment Uses ReplicaSet**
When you create a Deployment, Kubernetes automatically creates a **ReplicaSet** behind the scenes. The **ReplicaSet** is responsible for maintaining the specified number of **Pods**, ensuring they are always running and self-healing in case of failures.

- **Deployment** manages **ReplicaSets**.
- **ReplicaSet** manages **Pods**.
- Each update to the Deployment (like changing image version) creates a new ReplicaSet.
- Old ReplicaSets are kept for rollback purposes (unless cleaned up).

This layered architecture enables features like rollbacks and rolling updates while keeping the core ReplicaSet functionality.

---

## **How Deployment Uses ReplicaSet to Create Pods**

1. When you create a Deployment, Kubernetes checks the `spec.template` section of the Deployment.
2. A **ReplicaSet** is automatically created with the Pod template from the Deployment.
3. The ReplicaSet then creates the specified number of **Pods** using that template.
4. If you update the Deployment (like changing the image), a **new ReplicaSet** is created with the new template.
5. Kubernetes gradually scales down the old ReplicaSet and scales up the new one ‚Äî this is the **rolling update** mechanism.
6. You can always rollback to a previous ReplicaSet using `kubectl rollout undo`.

---

## **Types of Deployment Strategies**

### 1. **RollingUpdate (Default)**
- Updates pods gradually with zero downtime.
- Ensures a percentage of old and new pods are available during the transition.

```yaml
strategy:
  type: RollingUpdate
  rollingUpdate:
    maxSurge: 1
    maxUnavailable: 1
```

#### üîç Explanation:
- **type: RollingUpdate**: This tells Kubernetes to replace pods incrementally.
- **maxSurge: 1**: Allows 1 extra pod to be created above the desired count during updates.
- **maxUnavailable: 1**: Allows 1 pod to be temporarily unavailable during the update.

This ensures **zero downtime** by carefully balancing old and new pods.

---

### 2. **Recreate**
- Terminates all existing pods before creating new ones.
- May cause downtime but ensures clean state.

```yaml
strategy:
  type: Recreate
```

#### üîç Explanation:
- **type: Recreate**: All old pods are stopped before new ones are created.
- Useful for legacy apps or when new pods can't coexist with old ones.

May cause **temporary unavailability** but guarantees that only the new version runs.

---

## **Deployment YAML Example (RollingUpdate Strategy)**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx-container
        image: nginx:1.21
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

## **Deployment YAML Example (Recreate Strategy)**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment-recreate
spec:
  replicas: 2
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx-recreate
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx-container
        image: nginx:1.21
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

### 3. **Blue-Green Deployment (Approach)**
- Blue-Green is an **approach**, not a built-in Kubernetes strategy like RollingUpdate or Recreate.
- It involves running two separate environments ("blue" and "green") and switching traffic between them.
- Helps achieve zero downtime and quick rollback.

#### ‚úÖ Steps to Implement Blue-Green Deployment:

1. **Create Blue Deployment**:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment-blue
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-blue
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx-blue
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx-container
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        args:
          - echo "<h1> Hello from updated nginx----- blue pod!!!!!! </h1>" > /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html && nginx -g 'daemon off;'
```

2. **Create Green Deployment**:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment-green
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-green
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx-green
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx-container
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        args:
          - echo "<h1> Hello from updated nginx----- green pod!!!!!! </h1>" > /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html && nginx -g 'daemon off;'
```

3. **Service to Route Traffic (Initially to Blue):**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx-blue   # Initially sends traffic to blue deployment
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer
```

4. **Switching Traffic to Green**:
- Modify the service selector to point to `app: nginx-green`:
```yaml
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx-green
```
- Apply the updated Service manifest:
```sh
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```

5. **Rollback to Blue if Needed:**
- Again, update the Service selector back to `app: nginx-blue` and reapply.

#### üîÅ Summary:
- Blue-Green = Deploy two environments (blue + green)
- Route traffic to one using Service.
- Switch by changing the Service selector.
- Rollback is instant by pointing back to old version.

## **Managing Deployments**

### **Create a Deployment**
```sh
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

### **Check Deployment Status**
```sh
kubectl get deployments
kubectl describe deployment nginx-deployment
```

### **View Pods Managed by Deployment**
```sh
kubectl get pods
```

### **Check ReplicaSets Created by a Deployment**
```sh
kubectl get rs
```
Sample output:
```
NAME                          DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
nginx-deployment-7d8f4b68f5   3         3         3       5m
```

### **Check Pods Created by a ReplicaSet (managed by Deployment)**
```sh
kubectl get pods
```
Sample output:
```
nginx-deployment-7d8f4b68f5-abc12   1/1     Running   0          5m
nginx-deployment-7d8f4b68f5-def34   1/1     Running   0          5m
nginx-deployment-7d8f4b68f5-ghi56   1/1     Running   0          5m
```
These Pods are automatically named using the ReplicaSet name as a prefix.

### **Scale the Deployment**
```sh
kubectl scale deployment nginx-deployment --replicas=5
```

### **Update the Image (Rolling Update)**
```sh
kubectl set image deployment nginx-deployment nginx-container=nginx:1.22
```

### **Specify Change Cause**

You can add a custom change-cause to track changes made:

```sh
kubectl annotate deployment nginx-deployment kubernetes.io/change-cause="Updated image to nginx:1.22"
```

---

### **Automate Change Cause Recording**

To automatically track the cause of a change:

```sh
kubectl set image deployment nginx-deployment nginx-container=nginx:1.23 --record
```

This stores the command as the change cause.

Check the rollout history:

```sh
kubectl rollout history deployment nginx-deployment
```

**Sample Output:**
```
REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
1         kubectl apply --filename=deployment.yaml --record=true
2         kubectl set image deployment nginx-deployment nginx-container=nginx:1.22 --record=true
3         kubectl set image deployment nginx-deployment nginx-container=nginx:1.23 --record=true
```

If you forget to add `--record`, the change cause will be empty unless annotated manually.

---

### **Check Rollout History**

```sh
kubectl rollout history deployment nginx-deployment
```
Sample output:
```
REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
1         Initial deployment
2         Updated image to nginx:1.22
```

### **Rollback to Previous Version**

```sh
kubectl rollout undo deployment nginx-deployment
```


### **Rollback to a Specific Revision**

List the revision history:

```sh
kubectl rollout history deployment nginx-deployment
```

**Sample Output:**
```
REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
1         Initial deployment
2         Updated image to nginx:1.22
3         Updated image to nginx:1.23
```

Roll back to a specific revision (e.g., revision 1):

```sh
kubectl rollout undo deployment nginx-deployment --to-revision=1
```

**Output:**
```
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment rolled back to revision 1
```

Verify the change:

```sh
kubectl get rs
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe deployment nginx-deployment
```

---

## **Conclusion**
- Use **ReplicaSet** when you want fine control of pods (rare use case).
- Use **Deployment** for production workloads with automated updates and rollbacks.
- Deployment provides a declarative, powerful, and flexible way to manage stateless applications in Kubernetes.
- Under the hood, **Deployments use ReplicaSets** to ensure the desired state of **Pods**.
- You can verify the connection by checking `kubectl get rs` and `kubectl get pods` after deploying.
