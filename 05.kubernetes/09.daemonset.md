## **What is a DaemonSet?**
A **DaemonSet** ensures that **a copy of a specific Pod runs on all (or some) Nodes** in the Kubernetes cluster. When new nodes are added to the cluster, the DaemonSet automatically schedules the Pod onto those nodes as well.

### 🔍 Common Use Cases:
- Log collection agents (e.g., Fluentd, Logstash)
- Monitoring agents (e.g., Prometheus Node Exporter)
- Networking components (e.g., CNI plugins)
- Security and compliance agents

## **Why Do We Need a DaemonSet?**
Normally, Kubernetes schedules Pods on nodes based on resource availability and selectors. But what if we want **a Pod to run on every node**, regardless of these factors?

This is where **DaemonSets** come into play:
- Ensures **one Pod per Node** (unless explicitly configured otherwise).
- Automatically runs on new Nodes and is removed from Nodes that leave the cluster.
- Ideal for **node-level background tasks** or **system-wide services**.

## **DaemonSet YAML Example**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

### 🔍 Explanation:
- `kind: DaemonSet`: Tells Kubernetes to ensure one Pod runs per Node.
- `selector.matchLabels`: Matches the Pod template to be managed.
- `template`: Defines the Pod specification that will be run on every node.

## **Managing a DaemonSet**

### **Create a DaemonSet**
```sh
kubectl apply -f daemonset.yaml
```

### **List DaemonSets**
```sh
kubectl get daemonsets
```

### **Describe DaemonSet**
```sh
kubectl describe daemonset nginx
```

### **Check Running Pods**
```sh
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

### **Delete a DaemonSet**
```sh
kubectl delete daemonset nginx
```

> 🔔 Note: Deleting a DaemonSet will also delete all its managed Pods.

---

## **Conclusion**
- **DaemonSet** is ideal for running background services on all or specific nodes.
- It automatically handles new and removed nodes.
- Critical for **monitoring, logging, networking, and security tools** that must run across the cluster.

Use **DaemonSet** when you need something running **per node**, not just per cluster!
