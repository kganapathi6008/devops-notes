# Docker Multi-Host Networking: Overlay Networks

## Introduction to Multi-Host Networking

In Docker, multi-host networking enables containers running on different hosts to communicate securely, simulating a distributed application architecture. This is primarily achieved using **Overlay Networks**.

## What is an Overlay Network?

An **Overlay Network** is a software-defined network that sits on top of existing host networks. It allows containers running on different Docker hosts to communicate as if they are on the same local network, without needing complex routing setups.

Overlay networks use **VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN)** to encapsulate and transport network packets between hosts.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker Swarm mode** must be enabled for overlay networking.
- At least two Docker hosts (nodes) are required.
- All nodes must be able to communicate over ports 2377 (cluster management), 7946 (communication between nodes), and 4789 (overlay network traffic).

## Step 1: Initialize Docker Swarm

On the first host, initialize the swarm:
```bash
docker swarm init --advertise-addr <Manager-Node-IP>
```

This will display a token and command to join worker nodes to the swarm.

On the other hosts, run the join command (replace the token and IP with the values from the previous step):
```bash
docker swarm join --token <Token> <Manager-Node-IP>:2377
```

Verify the nodes are part of the swarm:
```bash
docker node ls
```

## Step 2: Create an Overlay Network

Create an overlay network that spans multiple hosts:
```bash
docker network create \
  --driver overlay \
  --attachable \
  my_overlay_network
```
- `--driver overlay`: Specifies the network driver.
- `--attachable`: Allows standalone containers (not in a swarm service) to connect to this network.

List networks to verify:
```bash
docker network ls
```

## Step 3: Deploy Services or Containers to the Overlay Network

### Deploy a service to the overlay network:
```bash
docker service create \
  --name nginx-service \
  --network my_overlay_network \
  -p 8080:80 \
  nginx
```
- `--network my_overlay_network`: Attaches the service to the overlay network.
- `-p 8080:80`: Maps port 8080 on the host to port 80 inside the container.

### Run a standalone container on the overlay network:
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name nginx-container \
  --network my_overlay_network \
  -p 8081:80 \
  nginx
```

## Step 4: Verify Communication Between Containers

You can test communication between containers running on different hosts:

1. **Access the shell of a running container:**
```bash
docker exec -it <container_id> sh
```

2. **Ping another container by name:**
```bash
ping <other_container_name>
```

If the containers are on the same overlay network, the ping should succeed!

## Step 5: Inspect the Overlay Network

Get detailed information about the overlay network:
```bash
docker network inspect my_overlay_network
```
You will see details about:
- Containers attached to the network.
- IP ranges assigned.
- Subnets.

## Accessing Applications

- **From outside the cluster:** Use the published ports (`-p` option) to access the services.
- **Within the cluster:** Containers can communicate using their names (DNS-based discovery is built into the overlay network).

Example:
```bash
curl http://nginx-service:80
```

## Summary

Overlay networks enable secure communication between Docker containers running on different hosts. By leveraging Docker Swarm mode, you can create scalable, distributed applications without complex networking configurations.
