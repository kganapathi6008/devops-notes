## 2. AWS Storage Types
AWS storage solutions can be classified into several types based on how data is stored and accessed:

### a. Object Storage

# Understanding EC2 Storage: /dev/xvda and Partitions

## When I Create an EC2 Instance with 10GB Storage
When you create an EC2 instance with **10GB storage** in the AWS Console, you are provisioning an **EBS volume (Elastic Block Store)** with a size of **10GB**. This volume is attached to your instance as a **block storage device**.

In the AWS Console, under the storage section, you will see the **Root device name: /dev/xvda**. This represents the **block device** attached to your EC2 instance.

## What Does `/dev/xvda` Mean?
`/dev/xvda` is a **device name** representing the entire block storage (virtual disk) attached to your EC2 instance. It is a virtual disk managed by AWS EBS and acts like a physical hard drive inside your virtual machine.

## How to Check It in the Terminal
After connecting to your EC2 instance via SSH, you can inspect the storage setup using the following commands:

### 1. Check Block Devices:
```bash
lsblk
```
**Output Example:**
```
NAME      MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
xvda      202:0    0  10G  0 disk
├─xvda1   202:1    0  10G  0 part /
├─xvda127 259:0    0   1M  0 part
└─xvda128 259:1    0  10M  0 part /boot/efi
```
Explanation:
- `xvda` → The **entire block storage device (10GB virtual disk)**.
- `xvda1` → **A partition inside `xvda`**, mounted as the root filesystem `/`.
- `xvda127` → **A 1MB partition (reserved)**, not mounted (likely GPT metadata or bootloader placeholder).
- `xvda128` → **A 10MB partition for EFI boot files**, mounted on `/boot/efi`.

### 2. Check Filesystem Usage:
```bash
df -h
```
\*\*Output Example:\*\*

```
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
devtmpfs        4.0M     0  4.0M   0% /dev
tmpfs           475M     0  475M   0% /dev/shm
tmpfs           190M  452K  190M   1% /run
/dev/xvda1      8.0G  1.6G  6.4G  20% /
tmpfs           475M     0  475M   0% /tmp
/dev/xvda128     10M  1.3M  8.7M  13% /boot/efi
tmpfs            95M     0   95M   0% /run/user/1000
/dev/xvdf        20G  175M   20G   1% /data
```

### 3. View Partition Table and Disk Details:
```bash
sudo fdisk -l
```
\*\*Output Example:\*\*
```
Disk /dev/xvda: 10 GiB, 10737418240 bytes, 20971520 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: gpt
Disk identifier: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX

Device       Start      End  Sectors  Size Type
/dev/xvda1    4096 20967423 20963328   10G Linux filesystem
/dev/xvda127  2048     4095     2048    1M BIOS boot
/dev/xvda128  411648  432127   20480   10M EFI System
```
Explanation:
- Displays detailed information about the entire disk and its partitions.
- Shows the disk size, sector size, partition table type (GPT), and partition details.
```
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/xvda1       10G  1.6G  8.4G  16% /
/dev/xvda128     10M  1.3M  8.7M  13% /boot/efi
```
Explanation:
- `/dev/xvda1` → Main partition containing the **root filesystem (`/`)**.
- `/dev/xvda128` → EFI partition mounted at `/boot/efi`.

## Key Differences: `/dev/xvda` vs `/dev/xvda1`
| Name          | Description                                  | Usage                                             |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `/dev/xvda`   | **The entire block device (10GB virtual disk)** | Contains partitions like `xvda1`, `xvda127`, etc.|
| `/dev/xvda1`  | **Partition inside `xvda` containing the OS**  | Mounted as the root filesystem `/`.               |
| `/dev/xvda127`| **Small reserved partition (1MB)**            | Typically unused, likely GPT metadata.            |
| `/dev/xvda128`| **EFI Boot Partition (10MB)**                 | Mounted at `/boot/efi` for bootloader files.      |

## Why AWS Console Shows `/dev/xvda`:
In the AWS Console, it displays **the root device name as `/dev/xvda`** because it is referring to the **entire block device** attached to your EC2 instance. Inside the instance, however, **the partitions like `/dev/xvda1` and `/dev/xvda128` are what actually hold the data and filesystem**.

## Summary:
- **`/dev/xvda`** → Whole block device (virtual disk).
- **`/dev/xvda1`** → Partition holding the root filesystem (`/`).
- **`/dev/xvda127`** → Small reserved partition (likely bootloader-related).
- **`/dev/xvda128`** → EFI boot partition (`/boot/efi`).

# EC2 Device Name Mapping

## AWS Console vs. Instance Device Names
When attaching an EBS volume to an EC2 instance, you specify a device name like `/dev/sdf`. However, inside the instance, the device may appear as `/dev/xvdf` or other variations.

### Why the Difference?
- AWS Console uses **`/dev/sdX`** naming (traditional SCSI disk convention).
- EC2 instances often use **Xen virtualization**, showing devices as **`/dev/xvdX`** inside the instance.

### Common Mappings:
| AWS Console Name | Instance Device Name |
|------------------|----------------------|
| `/dev/sdf`        | `/dev/xvdf`          |
| `/dev/sdg`        | `/dev/xvdg`          |
| `/dev/sdh`        | `/dev/xvdh`          |

### Nitro-based Instances (e.g., m5, c5, t3):
- EBS volumes appear as **NVMe devices**:
  - `/dev/sdf` → `/dev/nvme1n1`

### Useful Commands:
```bash
lsblk
ls /dev/xvd*
ls /dev/nvme*
sudo nvme list  # Nitro instances
```

# Understanding EC2 Storage in AWS

## 1. AWS Data Center (Hardware Layer)
- AWS data centers have **physical servers** with the following components:
  - **CPU** — for processing power
  - **RAM** — for memory
  - **Hard disk (local storage)** — SSDs or HDDs directly attached to the host machine
- These physical servers run virtual machines (EC2 instances) using a hypervisor.

## 2. EC2 Storage Types
EC2 instances use two main storage options:

### a) EBS (Elastic Block Store)
- **Network-attached storage** used by most EC2 instances.
- Root volume (where OS like Ubuntu or RedHat is installed) is usually EBS.
- EBS persists even if the instance stops or moves to a different server.
- **EBS volumes are stored on separate storage servers** within the same Availability Zone (AZ), not on the physical server hosting the EC2 instance.

### b) Instance Store
- **Directly attached storage** to the physical server hosting the EC2 instance.
- **Temporary** — data is lost if the instance stops or terminates.
- Available only for certain instance types (like `c5d`, `i3`).

## 3. How EC2 Uses Physical Servers
When you create a **normal EC2 instance** (EBS-backed):
- You use the **CPU** and **RAM** of a physical server.
- **You do NOT use the physical server's hard disk** — instead, your storage comes from an **EBS volume** (which is network-attached and stored separately).

The physical server’s **hard disk** is only used for:
- **Instance store volumes** — for temporary storage (available only for specific EC2 types like `c5d`, `i3`).
- **Internal AWS operations** — like hypervisor tasks or swap space.

## 4. Stop and Start Behavior
- **Stop:** Releases CPU/RAM, but EBS volumes remain and can reattach to a new physical server.
- **Start:** Instance may run on a different physical server, with EBS reattached over the network.

## 5. Comparison
| Feature       | EBS (Elastic Block Store)     | Instance Store                  |
|---------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Location**  | Separate storage server (network-attached) | Attached to host hardware       |
| **Persistence** | Persists after stop/start    | Data lost on stop/terminate     |
| **Use cases** | OS, databases, long-term data | Cache, temporary data           |
| **Instances** | All EC2 instances             | Specific types (`c5d`, `i3`)    |
