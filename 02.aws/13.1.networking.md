# Networking Calculations

## 1. Introduction
Networking calculations involve converting IP addresses, subnet masks, and binary values to efficiently manage and allocate network resources.

## 2. IP Addressing
IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numbers represented in dotted decimal notation, divided into four octets.

### Example:
```
192.168.1.1  ->  11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001
```

## 3. Binary Conversion of an IP Address
Each octet in an IP address can be converted to binary:

### Steps:
1. Convert each decimal value to binary using division by 2.
2. Read remainders in reverse order.

### Example: Convert 192 to binary
```
192 ÷ 2 = 96 remainder 0
96 ÷ 2 = 48 remainder 0
48 ÷ 2 = 24 remainder 0
24 ÷ 2 = 12 remainder 0
12 ÷ 2 = 6 remainder 0
6 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 0
3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1
1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1

Binary: 11000000
```

## 4. Binary Conversion Example: 255
```
255 ÷ 2 = 127 remainder 1
127 ÷ 2 = 63 remainder 1
63 ÷ 2 = 31 remainder 1
31 ÷ 2 = 15 remainder 1
15 ÷ 2 = 7 remainder 1
7 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 1
3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1
1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1

Binary: 11111111
```
### Verification:
```
2^7  2^6  2^5  2^4  2^3  2^2  2^1  2^0
128   64   32   16   8    4    2    1
 1     1    1    1    1    1    1    1   --> Binary: 11111111 (Multiple each one)
====================================
128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 255 ✅
```

## 5. Subnet Mask Calculation
A subnet mask defines which part of an IP address is for the network and which is for hosts.

### Common Subnet Masks and CIDR Notation:

| CIDR                          | Subnet Mask         | Network Bits | Host Bits | Total Hosts | Usable Hosts |

## 6. Calculating Usable Hosts in a Subnet
Formula:
```
Usable Hosts = (2^Host Bits) - 2
```
Example for /27 (Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.224):
```bash
Host Bits = 5
Usable Hosts = (2^5) - 2 = 32 - 2 = 30
## Those 2 IP's are reserved for Network Address and Broadcast Address
```

## 7. Subnetting Example
### Given:
- IP Address: 192.168.1.0/26
- Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.192
- Network Bits: 26
- Host Bits: 6
- Usable Hosts: 62

### Subnet Range Calculation:
- **Network Address:** 192.168.1.0
- **First Usable IP:** 192.168.1.1
- **Last Usable IP:** 192.168.1.62
- **Broadcast Address:** 192.168.1.63

## 8. AWS VPC CIDR Block Restriction
AWS allows you to specify an IPv4 CIDR block **between /16 and /28** for the following reasons:

- **Scalability & Routing Efficiency**: Ensures a balance between large and small networks.
- **Avoiding Large or Small Networks**: /16 provides enough IPs, and /28 prevents excessive fragmentation.
- **AWS Reserved IPs**: Each subnet reserves **5 IPs**.
- **Efficient Subnetting**: Ensures flexible network design without wastage.
- **Fixed Restriction**: Cannot be changed but can be extended using **additional CIDR blocks**.

# IP Address Guide

## Types of IP Addresses

### 1. **Public IP Address**
- **Definition:** A public IP address is assigned by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and is unique across the entire internet. It allows devices to communicate directly with other devices outside their local network.
- **Examples:** Used by web servers, email servers, and other internet-facing services.

### 2. **Private IP Address**
- **Definition:** A private IP address is assigned to devices within a local network (e.g., home, office). These addresses are not routable on the internet and must use NAT (Network Address Translation) to connect externally.
- **Examples:** Devices like routers, computers, and printers within your home network.

### 3. **Static IP Address**
- **Definition:** A manually assigned IP address that does not change unless altered by the user.
- **Examples:** Web servers, database servers, and other critical infrastructure.

### 4. **Dynamic IP Address**
- **Definition:** An IP address that is automatically assigned by a DHCP server and may change periodically.
- **Examples:** Most consumer internet connections use dynamic IPs.

# Identifying Network and Host Bits in a Binary IP Address

## **Step 1: Understand IP Address and Subnet Mask**
- An IP address consists of **32 bits**, divided into **four octets (8-bit blocks)**.
- The **subnet mask** determines how many bits are allocated for the **network** and how many for the **host**.
- Example Binary IP Address: `11111101`
  - If only 8 bits are shown, it's a single octet. Typically, a full IP address is `32 bits` long.

## **Step 2: Identify Network and Host Bits Based on Subnet Mask**
The subnet mask defines the **network (1s)** and **host (0s)** bits.

### **Common Subnet Masks and Their Bit Allocation:**

| Subnet Mask | Network Bits (1s) | Host Bits (0s) |
|-------------|------------------|---------------|
| **/24 (255.255.255.0)** | First 24 bits = Network | Last 8 bits = Host |
| **/26 (255.255.255.192)** | First 26 bits = Network | Last 6 bits = Host |
| **/30 (255.255.255.252)** | First 30 bits = Network | Last 2 bits = Host |

## **Step 3: Example Cases**
### **Case 1: /24 Subnet Mask (255.255.255.0)**
- IP: `11111101.x.x.x`
- **First 24 bits** → Network
- **Last 8 bits** → Host

### **Case 2: /26 Subnet Mask (255.255.255.192)**
- IP: `11111101.111111xx.x.x`
- **First 26 bits** → Network
- **Last 6 bits** → Host

### **Case 3: /30 Subnet Mask (255.255.255.252)**
- IP: `11111101.11111111.11111111.111111xx`
- **First 30 bits** → Network
- **Last 2 bits** → Host (only 4 possible addresses)

## **Step 4: How to Determine the Network and Host Bits?**
1. **Check the Subnet Mask**: It defines the boundary between network and host bits.
2. **Count the Number of 1s**: These represent the **network portion**.
3. **Remaining Bits are Host Bits**: These determine the number of possible devices in the subnet.

### **Conclusion**
- The subnet mask is essential to define network vs. host portions.
- More **network bits (1s)** → fewer **host bits (0s)** (fewer usable IPs).
- More **host bits (0s)** → larger subnet (more devices).

Using this approach, you can analyze any IP address and determine its **network and host parts** based on the subnet mask!
