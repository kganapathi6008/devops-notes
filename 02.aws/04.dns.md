# Managing DNS Records in GoDaddy

## What is DNS?
DNS (Domain Name System) is a system that translates human-readable domain names (e.g., example.com) into IP addresses (e.g., 18.170.221.107) that computers use to identify each other on the internet. It acts as the phonebook of the internet.

### How Does DNS Work?
When you type a website address (e.g., example.com) into your browser, the following steps occur:
1. **User Request**: You type `example.com` into your browser and press Enter.
2. **DNS Query**: Your computer sends a request to a DNS resolver (usually provided by your Internet Service Provider).
3. **Recursive Lookup**:
   - The resolver asks the **root DNS servers** (.) → “Where is `.com`?”
   - Then asks the **TLD (Top-Level Domain) servers** (e.g., `.com`) → “Where is `example.com`?”
   - Finally asks the **Authoritative DNS server** (e.g., GoDaddy or AWS Route 53) → “What is the IP address of `example.com`?”
4. **Response**: The authoritative server returns the IP address (e.g., `18.170.221.107`).
5. **Access Website**: Your browser uses the IP address to connect to the web server hosting the website.
6. **Caching**: The IP is cached locally on your device and ISP to speed up future requests.

### Diagram Concept (Textual Representation)
```
User -> DNS Resolver -> Root Servers (.) -> TLD Servers (.com) -> Authoritative Servers (e.g., GoDaddy) -> IP Address -> Web Server
```
You can visualize it like this:
```
  [User Browser]
       |
       v
  [DNS Resolver]
       |
       v
  [Root DNS Servers]
       |
       v
  [TLD DNS Servers (.com)]
       |
       v
[Authoritative DNS Server (GoDaddy)]
       |
       v
[Web Server - 18.170.221.107]
```

### Key Points:
- Root DNS Servers know where .com servers are.
- TLD DNS Servers know where example.com servers are.
- Authoritative DNS Servers (e.g., GoDaddy, Route 53) store the actual records (A, CNAME, etc.).
- Caching helps reduce the lookup time for frequently visited websites.

## What is GoDaddy?
GoDaddy is a domain registrar and web hosting company that allows individuals and businesses to register domain names, host websites, and manage DNS records.

## Why Use GoDaddy and DNS Management?
- To link your domain name to your web server's IP address.
- To create subdomains like `blog.example.com`.
- To set up email services (e.g., MX records).
- To ensure your website is accessible using a friendly domain name instead of an IP address.

## Where to Find Your Domain and Manage DNS in GoDaddy
1. Log in to your GoDaddy account at [https://www.godaddy.com](https://www.godaddy.com).
2. Click on **My Products** from the top-right menu.
3. Under **Domains**, find your domain name (e.g., example.com) and click **DNS** next to it.
4. You will be taken to the **DNS Management** page where you can add, edit, or delete DNS records.

## Common DNS Records in GoDaddy

### 1. A Record
An A record maps a domain to an IPv4 address. For example:

```
A    @    18.170.221.107    600 seconds
```

- `@` represents the root domain (e.g., example.com).
- `18.170.221.107` is the server IP address.
- `600 seconds` is the Time-to-Live (TTL), which determines how long the record is cached.

### 2. CNAME Record
A CNAME record maps a subdomain to another domain. For example:

```
CNAME    www    example.com.    1 Hour
```

- `www` maps `www.example.com` to `example.com`.

### 3. NS Record
NS records specify the name servers for your domain. These are typically managed by GoDaddy:

```
NS    @    ns01.domaincontrol.com.    1 Hour
NS    @    ns02.domaincontrol.com.    1 Hour
```

These should not be changed unless you are using custom name servers.

### 4. SOA Record
The SOA record contains administrative information about the domain:

```
SOA    @    Primary nameserver: ns01.domaincontrol.com.    1 Hour
```

This is also managed by GoDaddy and usually requires no changes.

## Special Entry: WebsiteBuilder Site
When you use GoDaddy's WebsiteBuilder, an A record like this may appear:

```
A    @    WebsiteBuilder Site    1 Hour
```

This record routes your root domain to GoDaddy's WebsiteBuilder service. It can interfere with custom A records.

### What to Do If You See This Entry
- If you are hosting your site elsewhere (e.g., on an EC2 instance), delete this **WebsiteBuilder Site** A record.
- Ensure you have a custom A record pointing to your server's IP:

```
A    @    [Your_Server_IP]    600 seconds
```

## Creating Subdomains
Subdomains can be created by adding A records or CNAME records. For example:

```
A    blog    18.170.221.107    600 seconds
A    shop    18.170.221.107    600 seconds
CNAME    support    example.com.    1 Hour
```

- `blog.example.com` will point to `18.170.221.107`.
- `shop.example.com` will point to `18.170.221.107`.
- `support.example.com` will point to `example.com`.

## Adding Load Balancer Details in DNS
If you are using a load balancer (e.g., AWS Elastic Load Balancer), you need to map your domain to the load balancer's DNS name.

- Use **CNAME** record if you are provided with a DNS name (e.g., `my-load-balancer-1234567890.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`).

Example:
```
CNAME    @    my-load-balancer-1234567890.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com.    1 Hour
CNAME    www  my-load-balancer-1234567890.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com.    1 Hour
```

## What is AWS Route 53?
Route 53 is a scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS) web service provided by AWS. It is used to manage domains and route internet traffic.

### Creating a Hosted Zone in Route 53
1. Go to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to **Route 53**.
3. Click on **Hosted Zones**.
4. Click **Create Hosted Zone**.
5. Enter your domain name (e.g., `example.com`).
6. Select **Public Hosted Zone** or **Private Hosted Zone** based on your requirement.
7. Click **Create Hosted Zone**.

### Public Hosted Zone vs. Private Hosted Zone
- **Public Hosted Zone**: Used when your domain should be accessible over the internet.
- **Private Hosted Zone**: Used when your domain should be accessible only within a specific VPC in AWS.

## Subdomain Delegation in Route 53
Subdomain delegation is the process of creating a subdomain and allowing another DNS service or hosted zone to manage it.

Example:
- You own `example.com` and manage it in Route 53.
- You want `blog.example.com` to be managed by another hosted zone or service.

Steps:
1. Create a new **Hosted Zone** for `blog.example.com` in Route 53.
2. Copy the **NS records** from this new hosted zone.
3. Go to the parent domain `example.com` hosted zone.
4. Add **NS record** for `blog` with the values copied from the new hosted zone.

This will delegate `blog.example.com` to be managed by the new hosted zone.

## Final Example DNS Setup for Custom Hosting
| Type  | Name  | Value                      | TTL      |
|-------|-------|-----------------------------|----------|
| A     | @     | 18.170.221.107              | 600s     |
| A     | apache| 18.170.221.107              | 600s     |
| A     | blog  | 18.170.221.107              | 600s     |
| A     | shop  | 18.170.221.107              | 600s     |
| CNAME | www   | example.com.                | 1 Hour   |
| CNAME | support | example.com.              | 1 Hour   |

## Summary
- Delete the **WebsiteBuilder Site** 'A record' if you are not using WebsiteBuilder.
- Ensure your **A record for `@`** points to your server IP to resolve to your root domain.
- Use **CNAME for `www`** if you want `www.example.com` to resolve to your root domain.
- Add **A records or CNAME records for subdomains** as needed.
- Use **CNAME** for load balancer DNS names.
- Allow some time for DNS changes to propagate.
