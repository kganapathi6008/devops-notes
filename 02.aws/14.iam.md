# AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

## Introduction
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. It allows you to create and manage AWS users and groups and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources.

---

## IAM Components

1. **Users**
   - Represents an individual person or application that interacts with AWS.
   - Each user has a unique name within the AWS account.
   - Users can be assigned permissions directly or through groups.
   - **Purpose**: To provide identity to an individual or an application.
   - **Example**: A developer who needs access to EC2 instances to review logs.
   - **When to use**: When you want to grant specific permissions to a person or application.

2. **Groups**
   - A collection of IAM users.
   - Groups let you assign permissions to multiple users at once.
   - **Purpose**: Simplify permission management by grouping users with similar responsibilities.
   - **Example**: *Developers*, *Admins*, *SupportTeams*.
   - **When to use**: When you have multiple users with the same access requirements.

3. **Roles**
   - IAM roles are used to grant permissions to entities that you trust (like AWS services or applications running on EC2).
   - Roles do not have long-term credentials (passwords or access keys) — instead, they use temporary security tokens.
   - **Purpose**: Allow AWS services or external identities to access resources securely.
   - **Example**: An EC2 instance assuming a role to access S3.
   - **When to use**: When AWS services need to interact with other resources without hardcoding credentials.

4. **Policies**
   - Policies are JSON documents that define permissions.
   - They specify who can access what and what actions they can perform.
   - Policies are attached to users, groups, and roles.
   - **Purpose**: Control permissions by defining rules for resource access.
   - **Example**: A policy allowing read-only access to S3 buckets.
   - **When to use**: To explicitly define what actions and resources are allowed or denied.
   - **Types of policies**:
     - **Managed Policies**: AWS-managed or customer-managed policies.
     - **Inline Policies**: Directly embedded within a user, group, or role.

5. **Identity Providers (IdPs)**
   - Used to federate AWS access with external identity systems (e.g., Google, Active Directory).
   - **Purpose**: Allow users to log in using existing corporate or social identities.
   - **Example**: Using Okta or Active Directory for single sign-on (SSO) into the AWS Management Console.
   - **When to use**: When integrating external user directories for secure and seamless access to AWS.

## Key Concepts

1. **Authentication**
   - Verifies who you are.
   - AWS supports:
     - Password-based access (for AWS Management Console).
     - Access keys (for CLI, SDK, or API access).
   - **Example**: Logging into the AWS console using a username and password.

2. **Authorization**
   - Determines what actions you can perform after authentication.
   - Defined using IAM policies.
   - **Example**: A user authenticated into the AWS console might have read-only access to S3 but full access to EC2, depending on their policy.

3. **Principal**
   - An entity that can perform actions on AWS resources (user, role, or service).

4. **Resource**
   - AWS resources (like EC2 instances, S3 buckets, etc.) that IAM policies control access to.

5. **Action**
   - Specific operations (like s3:PutObject or ec2:StartInstances).

6. **Condition**
   - Optional elements in policies that specify when permissions are granted or denied (based on time, IP address, MFA, etc.).

# Accessing AWS Resources

You can access AWS resources in multiple ways, depending on your needs and the level of automation or control you require. Let’s explore the main methods along with examples:

## 1. AWS Management Console
- A web-based interface for interacting with AWS services.
- Suitable for manual tasks, configuration, and monitoring.
- **Example**: Logging into the console and launching an EC2 instance by following the wizard.

## 2. AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)
- A tool to manage AWS services using terminal commands.
- Useful for automation, scripting, and CI/CD pipelines.
- **Example**: Running the following command to list all S3 buckets:

```bash
aws s3 ls
```

## 3. AWS SDKs (Software Development Kits)
- Libraries for various programming languages (Python, Java, Node.js, etc.) to interact with AWS APIs programmatically.
- **Example (Python using Boto3)**:

```python
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client('s3')
buckets = s3.list_buckets()
for bucket in buckets['Buckets']:
    print(bucket['Name'])
```

## 4. AWS CloudFormation
- A service for defining and provisioning AWS infrastructure using code (Infrastructure as Code - IaC).
- **Example**: Deploying an S3 bucket via a CloudFormation template.

## 5. AWS SDK for Terraform (HashiCorp Terraform)
- Use Terraform scripts to provision and manage AWS resources.
- **Example**: Defining an EC2 instance in a Terraform file and deploying it with `terraform apply`.

## 6. AWS API
- Directly call AWS services’ REST APIs.
- Suitable for custom integrations or when SDKs are not available.
- **Example**: Making an HTTP request to S3’s API to list buckets.

# Installing and Configuring AWS CLI

## Step 1: Install AWS CLI

### For Linux/Mac:

Follow these steps to install the AWS CLI on a Linux system: [AWS CLI Downloads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).
1. **Download the AWS CLI installer:**

```bash
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
```

2. **Unzip the installer:**

```bash
unzip awscliv2.zip
```

3. **Run the installer:**

```bash
sudo ./aws/install
```

4. **Verify the installation:**

By default, the AWS CLI is installed in `/usr/local/bin`. You can check the version using:

```bash
/usr/local/bin/aws --version
```

5. **Ensure the AWS CLI works globally:**

If running `aws --version` directly gives an error, add `/usr/local/bin` to your `PATH`:

```bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Alternatively, create a symbolic link to `/usr/bin`:

```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/aws /usr/bin/aws
```

Now, you should be able to run:

```bash
aws --version
```

This ensures you can use AWS CLI commands from any location in your terminal.

### For Windows:
Download and run the installer from [AWS CLI Downloads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).

### Verify Installation:

```bash
aws --version
```

---

## Step 2: Configure AWS CLI

Set up the CLI with your credentials and preferences:

```bash
aws configure
```

You’ll be prompted for:
- **AWS Access Key ID**: Your access key.
- **AWS Secret Access Key**: Your secret key.
- **Default region name**: Example: `eu-west-2`.
- **Default output format**: Options: `json`, `table`, `text`.

---

# Running AWS CLI Commands

### 1. **Help command**

View available commands and options:

```bash
aws help
```

### 2. **List S3 buckets**

```bash
aws s3 ls
```

### 3. **Create an S3 bucket in a specific region (eu-west-2)**

```bash
aws s3 mb s3://my-unique-bucket-name --region eu-west-2
```

### 4. **Describe EC2 instances in eu-west-2**

```bash
aws ec2 describe-instances --region eu-west-2
```

### 5. **Describe instances filtered by instance type**

```bash
aws ec2 describe-instances \
    --filters "Name=instance-type,Values=t2.micro" \
    --region eu-west-2
```

### 6. **Describe instances with custom output format (Instance ID and Subnet ID)**

```bash
aws ec2 describe-instances \
    --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].{Instance:InstanceId,Subnet:SubnetId}' \
    --output json \
    --region eu-west-2
```

### 7. **Terminate EC2 instances**

```bash
aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0 --region eu-west-2
```

### 8. **Create an EC2 instance in eu-west-2**

```bash
aws ec2 run-instances \
    --image-id ami-12345678 \
    --instance-type t2.micro \
    --key-name my-key-pair \
    --security-groups my-security-group \
    --region eu-west-2
```

# Additional Concepts

## IAM Roles for CLI and SDK
- When using AWS CLI or SDK from an EC2 instance, you can assign an IAM role to the instance.
- This allows the instance to access AWS resources without embedding credentials.

**Example**:

1. Create an IAM role with necessary permissions (like S3 access).
2. Attach the role to the EC2 instance.
3. The CLI will automatically use the role’s permissions without manual configuration.

```bash
aws s3 ls
```

---
---
---

## Providing Specific Permissions to Resources

To provide specific permissions to a particular resource, you can define an IAM policy.

**Example**: Allowing a user/group to only read from a specific S3 bucket:

```json
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Sid": "AllowListingAllBuckets",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
			"Resource": "*"
		},
		{
			"Sid": "AllowListingObjectsInMyS3Gana",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": "s3:ListBucket",
			"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-s3-gana"
		},
		{
			"Sid": "AllowReadingObjectsInMyS3Gana",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": "s3:GetObject",
			"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-s3-gana/*"
		}
	]
}

```

- This policy allows the user to read objects from the `my-s3-gana` but denies other actions.

**In short:**
- s3:ListAllMyBuckets = See bucket names.
- s3:ListBucket = See objects inside a specific bucket.
- s3:GetObject = Read objects inside a specific bucket.

## IAM Policy Example with All Keywords

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowListAllBuckets",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowS3AccessFromSpecificIP",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::my-s3-gana",
                "arn:aws:s3:::my-s3-gana/*"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "IpAddress": {
                    "aws:SourceIp": "49.37.157.12/32"
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "Sid": "DenyS3Delete",
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Action": "s3:DeleteObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-s3-gana/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Explanation of Keywords:
- **Version**: Defines the policy language version.
- **Statement**: Contains multiple policy statements.
- **Sid**: Describes the statement.
- **Effect**: Specifies whether actions are allowed or denied.
- **Principal**: Defines the entity to which the policy applies.
- **NotPrincipal**: Can be used to exclude specific entities.
- **Action**: Lists allowed actions.
- **NotAction**: Excludes certain actions.
- **Resource**: Specifies resources using ARNs.
- **NotResource**: Excludes specific resources.
- **Condition**: Adds conditions like IP restrictions or prefixes.
- **Condition Operators**: Used to control logic (e.g., IpAddress, StringEquals).

### Explanation of Policy:

This IAM policy contains three main statements:

1. **AllowListAllBuckets**:
   - Grants permission to list all S3 buckets in the account using the `s3:ListAllMyBuckets` action.
   - **Resource**: `*` means this action applies to all S3 buckets.
   - **Purpose**: Enables the user/group to view the list of available S3 buckets in the account.

2. **AllowS3AccessFromSpecificIP**:
   - Allows actions on a specific S3 bucket (`my-s3-gana`) and its objects:
     - List bucket contents (`s3:ListBucket`).
     - Get objects (`s3:GetObject`).
     - Upload objects (`s3:PutObject`).
   - **Condition**: These actions are only allowed if the request comes from the IP address `49.37.157.12/32`.

3. **DenyS3Delete**:
   - Explicitly denies the ability to delete objects (`s3:DeleteObject`) in the bucket `my-s3-gana`.
   - **Purpose**: Prevents object deletion, even if other policies grant delete permissions.

**In short:**
- The user `ganapathi@gmail.com` can list, get, and put objects in the bucket **only from IP `49.37.157.12`**.
- The user **cannot delete any objects** in the bucket — no matter what.

## IAM Policy to Manage Own Access Keys

This policy allows IAM users to manage their own access keys, including creating, listing, updating, and deleting keys.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowManageOwnAccessKeys",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:CreateAccessKey",
                "iam:ListAccessKeys",
                "iam:UpdateAccessKey",
                "iam:DeleteAccessKey",
                "iam:TagUser"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::741448933705:user/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Version**: Specifies the policy language version.
- **Sid**: A unique identifier for the statement.
- **Effect**: "Allow" grants the specified permissions.
- **Action**: Lists the IAM actions the user can perform:
  - `CreateAccessKey`: Create new access keys.
  - `ListAccessKeys`: View existing access keys.
  - `UpdateAccessKey`: Enable or disable keys.
  - `DeleteAccessKey`: Remove keys.
- **Resource**: Applies the actions to all users under the specified account (`741448933705`).

With this policy, users can manage their own access keys, ensuring they can securely access AWS resources through the CLI or SDK.

## Restricting Access by Role (Read-only for Developers, Full Access for DevOps)

**Scenario**:
- *Developers* should have read-only access.
- *DevOps* should have full access.

### Steps:

1. **Create a Developers Group**:
   - Attach the `ReadOnlyAccess` AWS-managed policy.

2. **Create a DevOps Group**:
   - Attach the `AdministratorAccess` AWS-managed policy.

### Example policy for Developers (Read-Only):

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:Describe*",
                "s3:Get*",
                "s3:List*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Example policy for DevOps (Full Access):

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "*",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

- Assign users to the appropriate groups based on their roles.

---

## Use Cases

1. **Granting EC2 instances access to S3**
   - Create an IAM role with an S3 access policy.
   - Attach the role to EC2 instances.

2. **Creating a Read-Only Admin group**
   - Define a group.
   - Attach the `ReadOnlyAccess` managed policy.
   - Add users to the group.

3. **Using IAM roles for Lambda functions**
   - Assign an IAM role to a Lambda function so it can access DynamoDB or SQS.

4. **Enabling federated access (SSO)**
   - Set up an identity provider (IdP).
   - Use IAM roles to map IdP users to AWS permissions.

5. **Restricting API access by IP**
   - Use condition keys in IAM policies to restrict actions to specific IP ranges.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for all IAM users.
2. **Use roles for applications** rather than embedding access keys.
3. **Apply least privilege**: Grant only the permissions necessary for tasks.
4. **Regularly rotate credentials** (access keys, passwords).
5. **Monitor IAM activity** with AWS CloudTrail.

## How to Generate a Policy
You can generate custom IAM policies easily using the **AWS Policy Generator**:

- Visit the AWS Policy Generator: [AWS Policy Generator](https://awspolicygen.s3.amazonaws.com/policygen.html)
- Select the Policy Type (e.g., S3 Bucket Policy, IAM Policy).
- Add statements by choosing Effect (Allow/Deny), Service, Actions, and Resources.
- Click **Generate Policy** to get the JSON policy.

### Sample Policy Generation
Here’s a simple example of generating a policy using the AWS Policy Generator:

1. **Effect**: Allow
2. **Service**: Amazon S3
3. **Actions**:
   - `s3:ListAllMyBuckets`
   - `s3:ListBucket`
   - `s3:GetObject`
   - `s3:PutObject`
4. **Resource**:
   - `arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket`
   - `arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*`

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowListAllBuckets",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowS3Access",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket",
                "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

This tool helps you create accurate, customized IAM policies without manually writing JSON.
