# AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

## Introduction
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. It allows you to create and manage AWS users and groups and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources.

---

## IAM Components

1. **Users**
   - Represents an individual person or application that interacts with AWS.
   - Each user has a unique name within the AWS account.
   - Users can be assigned permissions directly or through groups.
   - **Purpose**: To provide identity to an individual or an application.
   - **Example**: A developer who needs access to EC2 instances to review logs.
   - **When to use**: When you want to grant specific permissions to a person or application.

2. **Groups**
   - A collection of IAM users.
   - Groups let you assign permissions to multiple users at once.
   - **Purpose**: Simplify permission management by grouping users with similar responsibilities.
   - **Example**: *Developers*, *Admins*, *SupportTeams*.
   - **When to use**: When you have multiple users with the same access requirements.

3. **Roles**
   - IAM roles are used to grant permissions to entities that you trust (like AWS services or applications running on EC2).
   - Roles do not have long-term credentials (passwords or access keys) — instead, they use temporary security tokens.
   - **Purpose**: Allow AWS services or external identities to access resources securely.
   - **Example**: An EC2 instance assuming a role to access S3.
   - **When to use**: When AWS services need to interact with other resources without hardcoding credentials.

4. **Policies**
   - Policies are JSON documents that define permissions.
   - They specify who can access what and what actions they can perform.
   - Policies are attached to users, groups, and roles.
   - **Purpose**: Control permissions by defining rules for resource access.
   - **Example**: A policy allowing read-only access to S3 buckets.
   - **When to use**: To explicitly define what actions and resources are allowed or denied.
   - **Types of policies**:
     - **Managed Policies**: AWS-managed or customer-managed policies.
     - **Inline Policies**: Directly embedded within a user, group, or role.

5. **Identity Providers (IdPs)**
   - Used to federate AWS access with external identity systems (e.g., Google, Active Directory).
   - **Purpose**: Allow users to log in using existing corporate or social identities.
   - **Example**: Using Okta or Active Directory for single sign-on (SSO) into the AWS Management Console.
   - **When to use**: When integrating external user directories for secure and seamless access to AWS.

---

## Key Concepts

1. **Authentication**
   - Verifies who you are.
   - AWS supports:
     - Password-based access (for AWS Management Console).
     - Access keys (for CLI, SDK, or API access).
   - **Example**: Logging into the AWS console using a username and password.

2. **Authorization**
   - Determines what actions you can perform after authentication.
   - Defined using IAM policies.
   - **Example**: A user authenticated into the AWS console might have read-only access to S3 but full access to EC2, depending on their policy.

3. **Principal**
   - An entity that can perform actions on AWS resources (user, role, or service).

4. **Resource**
   - AWS resources (like EC2 instances, S3 buckets, etc.) that IAM policies control access to.

5. **Action**
   - Specific operations (like s3:PutObject or ec2:StartInstances).

6. **Condition**
   - Optional elements in policies that specify when permissions are granted or denied (based on time, IP address, MFA, etc.).

# Accessing AWS Resources

You can access AWS resources in multiple ways, depending on your needs and the level of automation or control you require. Let’s explore the main methods along with examples:

## 1. AWS Management Console
- A web-based interface for interacting with AWS services.
- Suitable for manual tasks, configuration, and monitoring.
- **Example**: Logging into the console and launching an EC2 instance by following the wizard.

## 2. AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)
- A tool to manage AWS services using terminal commands.
- Useful for automation, scripting, and CI/CD pipelines.
- **Example**: Running the following command to list all S3 buckets:

```bash
aws s3 ls
```

## 3. AWS SDKs (Software Development Kits)
- Libraries for various programming languages (Python, Java, Node.js, etc.) to interact with AWS APIs programmatically.
- **Example (Python using Boto3)**:

```python
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client('s3')
buckets = s3.list_buckets()
for bucket in buckets['Buckets']:
    print(bucket['Name'])
```

## 4. AWS CloudFormation
- A service for defining and provisioning AWS infrastructure using code (Infrastructure as Code - IaC).
- **Example**: Deploying an S3 bucket via a CloudFormation template.

## 5. AWS SDK for Terraform (HashiCorp Terraform)
- Use Terraform scripts to provision and manage AWS resources.
- **Example**: Defining an EC2 instance in a Terraform file and deploying it with `terraform apply`.

## 6. AWS API
- Directly call AWS services’ REST APIs.
- Suitable for custom integrations or when SDKs are not available.
- **Example**: Making an HTTP request to S3’s API to list buckets.

# Installing and Configuring AWS CLI

## Step 1: Install AWS CLI

### For Linux/Mac:

Follow these steps to install the AWS CLI on a Linux system: [AWS CLI Downloads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).
1. **Download the AWS CLI installer:**

```bash
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
```

2. **Unzip the installer:**

```bash
unzip awscliv2.zip
```

3. **Run the installer:**

```bash
sudo ./aws/install
```

4. **Verify the installation:**

By default, the AWS CLI is installed in `/usr/local/bin`. You can check the version using:

```bash
/usr/local/bin/aws --version
```

5. **Ensure the AWS CLI works globally:**

If running `aws --version` directly gives an error, add `/usr/local/bin` to your `PATH`:

```bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Alternatively, create a symbolic link to `/usr/bin`:

```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/aws /usr/bin/aws
```

Now, you should be able to run:

```bash
aws --version
```

This ensures you can use AWS CLI commands from any location in your terminal.

### For Windows:
Download and run the installer from [AWS CLI Downloads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).

### Verify Installation:

```bash
aws --version
```

---

## Step 2: Configure AWS CLI

Set up the CLI with your credentials and preferences:

```bash
aws configure
```

You’ll be prompted for:
- **AWS Access Key ID**: Your access key.
- **AWS Secret Access Key**: Your secret key.
- **Default region name**: Example: `eu-west-2`.
- **Default output format**: Options: `json`, `table`, `text`.

---

# Running AWS CLI Commands

### 1. **Help command**

View available commands and options:

```bash
aws help
```

### 2. **List S3 buckets**

```bash
aws s3 ls
```

### 3. **Create an S3 bucket in a specific region (eu-west-2)**

```bash
aws s3 mb s3://my-unique-bucket-name --region eu-west-2
```

### 4. **Describe EC2 instances in eu-west-2**

```bash
aws ec2 describe-instances --region eu-west-2
```

### 5. **Describe instances filtered by instance type**

```bash
aws ec2 describe-instances \
    --filters "Name=instance-type,Values=t2.medium" \
    --region eu-west-2
```

### 6. **Describe instances with custom output format (Instance ID and Subnet ID)**

```bash
aws ec2 describe-instances \
    --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].{Instance:InstanceId,Subnet:SubnetId}' \
    --output json \
    --region eu-west-2
```

### 7. **Terminate EC2 instances**

```bash
aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0 --region eu-west-2
```

### 8. **Create an EC2 instance in us-east-1** region

#### Step 1: Create a key pair

```bash
aws ec2 create-key-pair \
    --key-name dev-env-kp \
    --key-type rsa \
    --query 'KeyMaterial' \
    --region us-east-1 \
    --output text > dev-env-kp.pem
```

```bash
cat dev-env-kp.pem
```

#### Step 2: Get VPC details

```bash
aws ec2 describe-vpcs --region us-east-1
```

```bash
aws ec2 describe-vpcs --region us-east-1 --query "Vpcs[].VpcId" --output text
```

#### Step 3: Create a security group

```bash
aws ec2 create-security-group \
    --group-name httpd-sg \
    --description "Allow SSH and HTTP access" \
    --vpc-id vpc-0f2f073944b9d40b3
```

#### Step 4: Add inbound rules to the security group

```bash
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
    --group-id sg-04770c41b4088d907 \
    --protocol tcp \
    --port 22 \
    --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
```

```bash
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
    --group-id sg-04770c41b4088d907 \
    --protocol tcp \
    --port 80 \
    --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
```

#### Step 5: Get subnet details

```bash
aws ec2 describe-subnets \
    --filters "Name=vpc-id,Values=vpc-0f2f073944b9d40b3" \
    --query "Subnets[].{ID:SubnetId,CIDR:CidrBlock}" \
    --region us-east-1 \
    --output table
```

#### Step 6: Launch the EC2 instance

```bash
aws ec2 run-instances \
    --image-id ami-08b5b3a93ed654d19 \
    --instance-type t2.micro \
    --key-name dev-env-kp \
    --security-group-ids sg-04770c41b4088d907 \
    --subnet-id subnet-05888fe32c4d7100b \
    --region us-east-1
```

## Restricting Access by Role (Read-only for Developers, Full Access for DevOps)

**Scenario**:
- *Developers* should have read-only access.
- *DevOps* should have full access.

### Steps:

1. **Create a Developers Group**:
   - Attach the `ReadOnlyAccess` AWS-managed policy.

2. **Create a DevOps Group**:
   - Attach the `AdministratorAccess` AWS-managed policy.

### Example policy for Developers (Read-Only):

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:Describe*",
                "s3:Get*",
                "s3:List*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Example policy for DevOps (Full Access):

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "*",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

- Assign users to the appropriate groups based on their roles.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for all IAM users.
2. **Use roles for applications** rather than embedding access keys.
3. **Apply least privilege**: Grant only the permissions necessary for tasks.
4. **Regularly rotate credentials** (access keys, passwords).
5. **Monitor IAM activity** with AWS CloudTrail.

---
---
---

## Providing Specific Permissions to Resources

To provide specific permissions to a particular resource, you can define an IAM policy.

**Example**: Allowing a user/group to only read from a specific S3 bucket:

```json
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Sid": "AllowListingAllBuckets",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
			"Resource": "*"
		},
		{
			"Sid": "AllowListingObjectsInMyS3Gana",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": "s3:ListBucket",
			"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-s3-gana"
		},
		{
			"Sid": "AllowReadingObjectsInMyS3Gana",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": "s3:GetObject",
			"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-s3-gana/*"
		}
	]
}

```

- This policy allows the user to read objects from the `my-s3-gana` but denies other actions.

**In short:**
- s3:ListAllMyBuckets = See bucket names.
- s3:ListBucket = See objects inside a specific bucket.
- s3:GetObject = Read objects inside a specific bucket.

## IAM Policy Example with All Keywords

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowListAllBuckets",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowS3AccessFromSpecificIP",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::my-s3-gana",
                "arn:aws:s3:::my-s3-gana/*"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "IpAddress": {
                    "aws:SourceIp": "49.37.157.12/32"
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "Sid": "DenyS3Delete",
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Action": "s3:DeleteObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-s3-gana/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Explanation of Keywords:
- **Version**: Defines the policy language version.
- **Statement**: Contains multiple policy statements.
- **Sid**: Describes the statement.
- **Effect**: Specifies whether actions are allowed or denied.
- **Action**: Lists allowed actions.
- **NotAction**: Excludes certain actions.
- **Resource**: Specifies resources using ARNs.
- **NotResource**: Excludes specific resources.
- **Condition**: Adds conditions like IP restrictions or prefixes.
- **Condition Operators**: Used to control logic (e.g., IpAddress, StringEquals).

### Explanation of Policy:

This IAM policy contains three main statements:

1. **AllowListAllBuckets**:
   - Grants permission to list all S3 buckets in the account using the `s3:ListAllMyBuckets` action.
   - **Resource**: `*` means this action applies to all S3 buckets.
   - **Purpose**: Enables the user/group to view the list of available S3 buckets in the account.

2. **AllowS3AccessFromSpecificIP**:
   - Allows actions on a specific S3 bucket (`my-s3-gana`) and its objects:
     - List bucket contents (`s3:ListBucket`).
     - Get objects (`s3:GetObject`).
     - Upload objects (`s3:PutObject`).
   - **Condition**: These actions are only allowed if the request comes from the IP address `49.37.157.12/32`.

3. **DenyS3Delete**:
   - Explicitly denies the ability to delete objects (`s3:DeleteObject`) in the bucket `my-s3-gana`.
   - **Purpose**: Prevents object deletion, even if other policies grant delete permissions.

**In short:**
- The user `ganapathi@gmail.com` can list, get, and put objects in the bucket **only from IP `49.37.157.12`**.
- The user **cannot delete any objects** in the bucket — no matter what.

## IAM Policy to Manage Own Access Keys

This policy allows IAM users to manage their own access keys, including creating, listing, updating, and deleting keys.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowManageOwnAccessKeys",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:CreateAccessKey",
                "iam:ListAccessKeys",
                "iam:UpdateAccessKey",
                "iam:DeleteAccessKey",
                "iam:TagUser"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::741448933705:user/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Version**: Specifies the policy language version.
- **Sid**: A unique identifier for the statement.
- **Effect**: "Allow" grants the specified permissions.
- **Action**: Lists the IAM actions the user can perform:
  - `CreateAccessKey`: Create new access keys.
  - `ListAccessKeys`: View existing access keys.
  - `UpdateAccessKey`: Enable or disable keys.
  - `DeleteAccessKey`: Remove keys.
- **Resource**: Applies the actions to all users under the specified account (`741448933705`).

With this policy, users can manage their own access keys, ensuring they can securely access AWS resources through the CLI or SDK.

## How to Generate a Policy
You can generate custom IAM policies easily using the **AWS Policy Generator**:

- Visit the AWS Policy Generator: [AWS Policy Generator](https://awspolicygen.s3.amazonaws.com/policygen.html)
- Select the Policy Type (e.g., S3 Bucket Policy, IAM Policy).
- Add statements by choosing Effect (Allow/Deny), Service, Actions, and Resources.
- Click **Generate Policy** to get the JSON policy.

### Sample Policy Generation
Here’s a simple example of generating a policy using the AWS Policy Generator:

1. **Effect**: Allow
2. **Service**: Amazon S3
3. **Actions**:
   - `s3:ListAllMyBuckets` --> Resource: `*`
   - `s3:ListBucket`--> Resource: `arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket`
   - `s3:GetObject`--> Resource: `arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*`
   - `s3:PutObject`--> Resource: `arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*`

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowListAllBuckets",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowBucketAccess",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowObjectAccess",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
        }
    ]
}

```

This tool helps you create accurate, customized IAM policies without manually writing JSON.

# Additional Concepts

## How AWS CLI Works with IAM Roles on EC2 Instances

When an EC2 instance has an IAM role attached, AWS CLI commands can run without explicitly configuring credentials. This is possible because AWS provides temporary security credentials through the **Instance Metadata Service (IMDS)**.

## Understanding IAM Roles on EC2
By default, AWS CLI is not installed on all EC2 instances, except for some Amazon Linux distributions. However, when an IAM role is attached to an instance, it can access AWS services without manually setting up credentials.

Even without installing AWS CLI, some systems may have it pre-installed, or AWS SDKs and tools may use the instance metadata to authenticate requests.

## Instance Metadata Service (IMDS)
AWS provides temporary credentials to EC2 instances via the **Instance Metadata Service (IMDS)**. The metadata service is available at:

```
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
```

### Useful Metadata Commands
Below are some useful metadata commands to retrieve important instance details:

#### Retrieve IAM Role Details
```
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/
```
Returns the IAM role name attached to the instance.

#### Fetch Temporary Credentials
```
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/<role-name>
```
Retrieves the temporary access credentials.

#### Get Public IP Address
```
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4
```
Returns the public IP address assigned to the instance.

#### Get Private IP Address
```
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/local-ipv4
```
Returns the private IP address of the instance.

#### Get Instance ID
```
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id
```
Returns the unique instance ID.

#### Get Instance Type
```
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-type
```
Returns the instance type (e.g., `t3.medium`).

#### Get Availability Zone
```
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/placement/availability-zone
```
Returns the Availability Zone where the instance is running.

#### Get Region
```
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/placement/region
```
Returns the AWS region of the instance.

#### Get AMI ID
```
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ami-id
```
Returns the AMI ID used to launch the instance.

#### Get VPC ID
```
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/network/interfaces/macs/<mac>/vpc-id
```
Returns the VPC ID associated with the instance. Replace `<mac>` with the actual MAC address of the network interface.

## AWS CLI Credential Resolution Order
When running AWS CLI commands, the tool searches for credentials in the following order:

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Set credentials manually:
     ```
     export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
     export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
     export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=your-session-token
     ```

2. **Shared Credentials File**
   - Stored in `~/.aws/credentials`:
     ```
     [default]
     aws_access_key_id=your-access-key-id
     aws_secret_access_key=your-secret-access-key
     aws_session_token=your-session-token
     ```

3. **Instance Metadata Service (IMDS)**
   - Used automatically when an IAM role is attached:
     ```
     curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/
     ```

4. **Container Credentials (For ECS & EKS)**
   - Used for ECS tasks and EKS pods when IAM roles are assigned dynamically.
   - In ECS, task roles provide credentials via:
     ```
     curl 169.254.170.2$AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI
     ```
   - In EKS, IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) allow pods to assume IAM roles securely.

## Running AWS CLI Commands on EC2 with IAM Roles
With an IAM role attached, AWS CLI commands can run directly without requiring `aws configure`. For example:

```
aws s3 ls
```

This command works because AWS CLI fetches temporary credentials from IMDS.

Even if AWS CLI is not installed, AWS SDKs and other AWS tools can still authenticate API requests using IMDS credentials.

## Conclusion
Even if AWS CLI is not pre-installed or configured manually, attaching an IAM role to an EC2 instance enables AWS CLI commands to work by retrieving temporary credentials from the Instance Metadata Service. Additionally, AWS SDKs and other AWS tools can leverage these credentials to interact with AWS services.

For ECS and EKS, container credentials allow workloads to access AWS resources securely, either through task roles in ECS or IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) in EKS.
