# Managing DNS Records in GoDaddy

## What is DNS?
DNS (Domain Name System) is a system that translates human-readable domain names (e.g., example.com) into IP addresses (e.g., 35.35.35.35) that computers use to identify each other on the internet. It acts as the phonebook of the internet.

### How Does DNS Work?
When you type a website address (e.g., example.com) into your browser, the following steps occur:
1. **User Request**: You type `example.com` into your browser and press Enter.
2. **DNS Query**: Your computer sends a request to a DNS resolver (usually provided by your Internet Service Provider).
3. **Recursive Lookup**:
   - The resolver asks the **root DNS servers** (.) → “Where is `.com`?”
   - Then asks the **TLD (Top-Level Domain) servers** (e.g., `.com`) → “Where is `example.com`?”
   - Finally asks the **Authoritative DNS server** (e.g., GoDaddy or AWS Route 53) → “What is the IP address of `example.com`?”
4. **Response**: The authoritative server returns the IP address (e.g., `35.35.35.35`).
5. **Access Website**: Your browser uses the IP address to connect to the web server hosting the website.
6. **Caching**: The IP is cached locally on your device and ISP to speed up future requests.

### Diagram Concept (Textual Representation)
```
User -> DNS Resolver -> Root Servers (.) -> TLD Servers (.com) -> Authoritative Servers (e.g., GoDaddy) -> IP Address -> Web Server
```
You can visualize it like this:
```
  [User Browser]
       |
       v
  [DNS Resolver]
       |
       v
  [Root DNS Servers]
       |
       v
  [TLD DNS Servers (.com)]
       |
       v
[Authoritative DNS Server (GoDaddy)]
       |
       v
[Web Server - 35.35.35.35]
```

### Key Points:
- Root DNS Servers know where .com servers are.
- TLD DNS Servers know where example.com servers are.
- Authoritative DNS Servers (e.g., GoDaddy, Route 53) store the actual records (A, CNAME, etc.).
- Caching helps reduce the lookup time for frequently visited websites.

## What is GoDaddy?
GoDaddy is a domain registrar and web hosting company that allows individuals and businesses to register domain names, host websites, and manage DNS records.

## Why Use GoDaddy and DNS Management?
- To link your domain name to your web server's IP address.
- To create subdomains like `blog.example.com`.
- To set up email services (e.g., MX records).
- To ensure your website is accessible using a friendly domain name instead of an IP address.

## Where to Find Your Domain and Manage DNS in GoDaddy
1. Log in to your GoDaddy account at [https://www.godaddy.com](https://www.godaddy.com).
2. Click on **My Products** from the top-right menu.
3. Under **Domains**, find your domain name (e.g., example.com) and click **DNS** next to it.
4. You will be taken to the **DNS Management** page where you can add, edit, or delete DNS records.

## Common DNS Records in GoDaddy

### 1. A Record
An A record maps a domain to an IPv4 address. For example:

```
A    @    35.35.35.35    600 seconds
```

- `@` represents the root domain (e.g., example.com).
- `35.35.35.35` is the server IP address.
- `600 seconds` is the Time-to-Live (TTL), which determines how long the record is cached.

### 2. CNAME Record
A CNAME record maps a subdomain to another domain. For example:

```
CNAME    www    example.com.    1 Hour
```

- `www` maps `www.example.com` to `example.com`.

### 3. NS Record
NS records specify the name servers for your domain. These are typically managed by GoDaddy:

```
NS    @    ns01.domaincontrol.com.    1 Hour
NS    @    ns02.domaincontrol.com.    1 Hour
```

These should not be changed unless you are using custom name servers.

### 4. SOA Record
The SOA record contains administrative information about the domain:

```
SOA    @    Primary nameserver: ns01.domaincontrol.com.    1 Hour
```

This is also managed by GoDaddy and usually requires no changes.

## Special Entry: WebsiteBuilder Site
When you use GoDaddy's WebsiteBuilder, an A record like this may appear:

```
A    @    WebsiteBuilder Site    1 Hour
```

This record routes your root domain to GoDaddy's WebsiteBuilder service. It can interfere with custom A records.

### What to Do If You See This Entry
- If you are hosting your site elsewhere (e.g., on an EC2 instance), delete this **WebsiteBuilder Site** A record.
- Ensure you have a custom A record pointing to your server's IP:

```
A    @    [Your_Server_IP]    600 seconds
```

## Creating Subdomains
Subdomains can be created by adding A records or CNAME records. For example:

```
A        blog       35.35.35.35    600 seconds
A        shop       35.35.35.35    600 seconds
CNAME    support    example.com.      1 Hour
```

- `blog.example.com` will point to `35.35.35.35`.
- `shop.example.com` will point to `35.35.35.35`.
- `support.example.com` will point to `example.com`.

## Final Example DNS Setup for Custom Hosting
| Type  | Name  | Value                       | TTL      |
|-------|-------|-----------------------------|----------|
| A     | @     | 35.35.35.35              | 600s     |
| A     | apache| 35.35.35.35              | 600s     |
| A     | blog  | 35.35.35.35              | 600s     |
| A     | shop  | 35.35.35.35              | 600s     |
| CNAME | www   | example.com.                | 1 Hour   |
| CNAME | support | example.com.              | 1 Hour   |

## Summary
- Delete the **WebsiteBuilder Site** 'A record' if you are not using WebsiteBuilder.
- Ensure your **A record for `@`** points to your server IP to resolve to your root domain.
- Use **CNAME for `www`** if you want `www.example.com` to resolve to your root domain.
- Add **A records or CNAME records for subdomains** as needed.
- Use **CNAME** for load balancer DNS names.
- Allow some time for DNS changes to propagate.

# AWS Route 53

## What is AWS Route 53?
AWS Route 53 is a scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS) web service. It is designed to give developers and businesses an extremely reliable and cost-effective way to route end users to applications hosted on AWS infrastructure or other locations.

### Key Features:
- Domain Registration
- DNS Management
- Traffic Routing
- Health Checks
- DNS Failover

## Public Hosted Zone vs. Private Hosted Zone

| Public Hosted Zone               | Private Hosted Zone                          |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Routes traffic from the internet to your resources. | Routes traffic only within your VPC(s). |
| Used when hosting public websites or services. | Used for internal applications within AWS. |

## Creating a Hosted Zone in AWS Route 53

1. **Open AWS Console:** Navigate to **Route 53**.
2. **Hosted Zones:** Click on **Hosted Zones** from the left panel.
3. **Create Hosted Zone:**
   - **Domain Name:** Enter your domain name (e.g., `example.com`).
   - **Type:** Choose **Public Hosted Zone** or **Private Hosted Zone**.
4. **Create Records:** Once the hosted zone is created, you can add DNS records like:
   - **A Record:** For IP address mapping.
   - **CNAME:** Alias for another domain.
   - **MX Record:** For mail servers.

## Subdomain Delegation in Route 53
Subdomain delegation is the process of assigning a subdomain (e.g., `sub.example.com`) to a different set of name servers, often a different hosted zone in Route 53.

### Steps to Delegate a Subdomain in Route 53:
1. **Create a Hosted Zone:**
   - Open **Route 53** → **Hosted Zones** → **Create Hosted Zone**.
   - Enter **sub.example.com** as the domain name.
   - Choose **Public Hosted Zone**.
2. **Note NS Records:**
   - Once created, note the **NS Records** for the subdomain.
3. **Add NS Records to Parent Zone:**
   - Go to the parent hosted zone for `example.com`.
   - Create a **NS Record** for `sub.example.com`.
   - Paste the **NS Records** from the subdomain’s hosted zone.
4. **Create Subdomain Records:**
   - Inside the subdomain hosted zone, create records like **A Record**, **CNAME**, etc., as needed.

## Connecting GoDaddy Domain to Route 53 Hosted Zone

Once you create a **Public Hosted Zone** in Route 53, AWS provides **4 Name Servers (NS Records)**. You need to replace the default GoDaddy name servers with these AWS Route 53 name servers.

### Steps to Route Traffic from GoDaddy to AWS Route 53:

1. **Get AWS Name Servers:**
   - After creating the hosted zone in AWS Route 53, note the 4 name servers listed under **NS Record** (e.g., `ns-123.awsdns-45.com`).

2. **Login to GoDaddy:**
   - Open [GoDaddy Dashboard](https://www.godaddy.com/).
   - Go to **My Products** → Click **DNS** next to your domain.

3. **Change Name Servers:**
   - In the DNS Management section, locate the **Name Servers**.
   - Click **Change**.
   - Select **Enter my own nameservers (advanced)**.
   - Replace the existing GoDaddy name servers with the 4 Route 53 name servers from AWS.

4. **Save Changes:**
   - Click **Save**.

## Propagation Time
DNS changes may take some time to propagate (typically up to 24-48 hours, but often faster).

## Verification
Once propagation is complete, your domain will now resolve based on the records you have configured in AWS Route 53.

### Using `nslookup`
```bash
nslookup example.com
```
#### Expected Output Example:
```
Server:  8.8.8.8
Address: 8.8.8.8#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:    example.com
Address: 35.35.35.35
```
Explanation:
- **Server:** The DNS resolver being used (e.g., Google DNS `8.8.8.8`).
- **Non-authoritative answer:** The response is from a cached record, not directly from the authoritative nameserver.
- **Name:** The domain queried.
- **Address:** The IP address associated with the domain.

### Using `dig`
```bash
dig example.com
```
#### Expected Output Example (Truncated):
```
; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> example.com
;; global options: +cmd
;; ANSWER SECTION:
example.com.    3600    IN    A    35.35.35.35
```
Explanation:
- **ANSWER SECTION:** Shows the IP address (A record) for the queried domain.
- **35.35.35.35:** The IP address that your domain resolves to.

## Summary
| Task                                 | Action                                          |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Create Hosted Zone in AWS Route 53   | Add records for your domain.                    |
| Get NS Records from Route 53         | Copy the 4 name servers.                        |
| Update Name Servers in GoDaddy       | Replace with AWS name servers.                  |
| Verify                               | Use `nslookup` or `dig` to confirm.             |

By configuring this, all DNS queries for your domain will now be handled by **AWS Route 53** instead of **GoDaddy’s DNS servers**.

# Handling HTTP to HTTPS Redirection Issues in Browsers

## Why Browsers Redirect to HTTPS
Modern web browsers often automatically upgrade connections from HTTP to HTTPS for security reasons. This behavior can sometimes cause issues when a server is not configured for HTTPS. Common scenarios include:

- The browser has previously visited the HTTPS version of a site.
- The website has HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) enabled.
- The browser caches the HTTPS version and continues redirecting future visits.

## Symptoms
- Typing `http://example.com` in the browser redirects to `https://example.com`.
- The HTTPS version fails with an error like **"This site can’t be reached"** or **"Connection Timed Out"**.
- Using an incognito/private window works fine with HTTP.

### Example Case
If you type `http://example.com` in your normal browser, it may automatically redirect to `https://example.com`, and you might get an error such as:

```
This site can’t be reached
example.com took too long to respond.
Try:
Checking the connection
Checking the proxy and the firewall
Running Windows Network Diagnostics
ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT
```

However, when you open an **incognito/private window** and type the same `http://example.com`, it may work fine. This is because incognito mode does not rely on your regular browser cache and stored HTTPS upgrades.

## Solutions

### 1. Clear Browser Cache
To remove cached HTTPS redirection:

- **Google Chrome:**
  - Open Settings → Privacy and Security → Clear Browsing Data.
  - Select **Cached images and files**.
  - Click **Clear Data**.
- Alternatively, use **Ctrl + Shift + R** to hard refresh the page.
- **Using DevTools to Empty Cache and Hard Reload:**
  - Open **Google Chrome**.
  - Press **F12** (or **Ctrl + Shift + I**) to open **DevTools**.
  - While **DevTools is open**, **right-click the refresh button** (🔄) near the address bar.
  - You will see three options:
    - **Normal Reload**
    - **Hard Reload**
    - **Empty Cache and Hard Reload**
  - Select **Empty Cache and Hard Reload**. This clears the cache for that specific site and reloads it freshly.

### 2. Explicitly Use HTTP
Manually type `http://` before the domain to ensure the browser does not default to HTTPS.

Example:
```
http://example.com
```

### 3. Install SSL Certificate (Recommended)
Enable HTTPS on your server using a valid SSL certificate:

- Use **Let’s Encrypt** (Free SSL certificate provider).
- Use **AWS Certificate Manager** if you are using an AWS Load Balancer.
- Install **Certbot** on your server for easy SSL setup with Let’s Encrypt.

### 4. Check DNS and Connection
Ensure DNS and server settings are correct:

```
nslookup example.com
curl -v http://example.com
```

These commands help verify DNS resolution and HTTP connection.

## Summary
| Issue                          | Solution                                    |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Redirecting to HTTPS           | Clear Cache / Use HTTP explicitly           |
| HTTPS not working              | Install SSL Certificate                     |
| DNS/Server issues              | Use `nslookup` and `curl` for testing       |

Implementing HTTPS is the best long-term solution for security and compatibility.
