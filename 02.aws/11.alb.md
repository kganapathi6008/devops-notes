# Routing Traffic Based on Application Context Using ALB

## Scenario Overview
We have the following setup:
- `172.55.55.51:8080/java-app-1/`
- `172.55.55.52:8080/java-app-1/`
- `172.55.55.53:8080/java-app-2/`

### Why Not Use NLB?
A **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** operates at **Layer 4 (TCP/UDP)** and can only route traffic based on **IP and port**. It cannot route requests based on URL paths like `/java-app-1/` or `/java-app-2/`. Therefore, a single NLB cannot differentiate requests based on the application context.

While using multiple NLBs might work by splitting traffic based purely on ports, the correct way to route requests based on **URL paths** is by using an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**.

## Solution Using ALB

### 1. Path-Based Routing

#### Steps to Achieve Path-Based Routing with ALB

#### Create Target Groups
Target groups are used to route requests to the appropriate backend instances.

- Go to **EC2** -> **Target Groups** -> **Create Target Group**.

**Follow this process:**

1. **Choose a target type:**
   - Select **IP** to directly add instance IP addresses.

2. **Target group name:**
   - **java-app-1** for the first target group.
   - **java-app-2** for the second target group.

3. **Protocol:**
   - **HTTP**

4. **Port:**
   - **80** → This is the port on which ALB talks to the Target group.

5. **Health checks:**

   **Health check protocol:**
   - **HTTP**

   **Health check path:**
   - `/java-app-1/` for the first target group.
   - `/java-app-2/` for the second target group.

   **Health check port:**
   - **Traffic port** → This means the health checks will be sent to the same port your targets are using, which is **8080**.

   **Healthy threshold:**
   - **2** → The number of consecutive successful health checks required for a target to be considered healthy.

   **Unhealthy threshold:**
   - **2** → The number of consecutive failed health checks required for a target to be considered unhealthy.

   **Timeout:**
   - **5 seconds** → How long ALB waits for a response from the target before marking it as a failure.

   **Interval:**
   - **15 seconds** → The interval between health check attempts.

6. **Register targets:**

   **Add IP addresses:**
   - `172.55.55.51` (for **java-app-1** target group)
   - `172.55.55.52` (for **java-app-1** target group)
   - `172.55.55.53` (for **java-app-2** target group)

   **Ports for the selected instances:**
   - **8080** → This is the port your backend applications are running on. ALB will forward traffic to these instances on this port.

7. **Include as pending below:**
   - Click **Create the Target Group**.

#### Create an ALB

- Navigate to the AWS Management Console.
- Go to **EC2** -> **Load Balancers** -> **Create Load Balancer**.
- Select **Application Load Balancer**.
- Set up the following:
  - **Name:** `my-application-alb`
  - **Scheme:** Internet-facing (or Internal, based on your use case)
  - **Listeners:**
    - HTTP, Port **80** (to allow traffic without needing to specify port 8080 in the URL)
  - **VPC:** Choose your existing VPC
  - **Availability Zones:** Select at least two subnets for high availability
  - **Default action:** Forward to one of the target groups (you can modify rules later)

- Click **Create**.

**Note:** ALB requires at least one listener during creation, and a default action must be defined, typically forwarding to a target group.

#### Configure Listener Rules

- **Load Balancers** -> Select ALB -> **Listeners** tab -> **View/edit rules** (port 80)
- Add new rules:
  - **If path is `/java-app-1/`** -> **Forward to `tg-java-app-1`**
  - **If path is `/java-app-2/`** -> **Forward to `tg-java-app-2`**

#### **Set Up DNS Records**

For host-based routing to work, you need to set up DNS records in **Route 53** or your DNS provider.

1. Navigate to your DNS provider or AWS Route 53.
2. Create **A records (Alias Records)** (or **CNAME records** if needed):
   - Domain-Name → ALB's DNS name
3. Ensure the records point to your ALB.

#### Test the Setup
Once the ALB is set up and rules are configured:

- Access the ALB's DNS name (found in the Load Balancer description):
   - `http://<Domain-Name>/java-app-1/` should route to `172.55.55.51` or `172.55.55.52`
   - `http://<Domain-Name>/java-app-2/` should route to `172.55.55.53`

#### Summary
- **NLB** cannot route based on paths — only IP and port.
- **ALB** allows for path-based routing using listener rules.
- We configured two target groups:
  - One for `/java-app-1/` on port 8080.
  - Another for `/java-app-2/` on port 8080.
- The ALB routes traffic based on the URL path, ensuring the correct backend service handles each request.
- Health checks are set up using the correct paths (`/java-app-1/` and `/java-app-2/`).

- This approach allows for flexible and dynamic routing of application traffic based on context-specific paths.

### 2. Host-Based Routing

#### Steps to Achieve Host-Based Routing with ALB

#### **Create Target Groups**

Just like path-based routing, we need to create target groups:

- **java-app-1** (for IPs `172.55.55.51` and `172.55.55.52`)
- **java-app-2** (for IP `172.55.55.53`)

**Steps:**
1. Go to **EC2** -> **Target Groups** -> **Create Target Group**.
2. Select **IP** as the target type.
3. Set **Protocol** to **HTTP** and **Port** to **8080**.
4. Define the health check paths:
   - `/java-app-1/` for the **java-app-1** target group.
   - `/java-app-2/` for the **java-app-2** target group.
5. Register the targets by adding the correct IP addresses.
6. Click **Create**.

#### **Configure ALB**

1. Go to **EC2** -> **Load Balancers** -> **Create Load Balancer**.
2. Choose **Application Load Balancer**.
3. Set the following details:
   - **Name:** `my-application-alb`
   - **Scheme:** Internet-facing (or internal, as needed)
   - **Listeners:** HTTP on port **80**
   - **VPC:** Select your existing VPC
   - **Subnets:** Select at least two subnets
4. For the **default action**, select any target group (you can modify rules later).
5. Click **Create**.

#### Set Up DNS Records (DNS Setup)

Ensure you have DNS records pointing to your ALB, such as:

- **java-app-1.example.com** -> ALB DNS name
- **java-app-2.example.com** -> ALB DNS name

You can configure this in your DNS provider (like Route 53):

1. Go to your domain’s DNS settings.
2. Add two **A records**:
   - **Name:** `java-app-1.example.com`
   - **Alias:** ALB DNS name

   - **Name:** `java-app-2.example.com`
   - **Alias:** ALB DNS name

#### Configure Listener Rules for Host-Based Routing

1. In the AWS console, go to **EC2** -> **Load Balancers** -> select your ALB.
2. Go to the **Listeners** tab.
3. Click **View/edit rules** for port **80**.
4. Add two rules:

- **If hostname is `java-app-1.<Domain-Name>`** -> **Forward to target group `java-app-1`**.
- **If hostname is `java-app-2.<Domain-Name>`** -> **Forward to target group `java-app-2`**.

5. Click **Save**.

#### Test the Setup

- `http://java-app-1.example.com/java-app-1/` should route to either `172.55.55.51` or `172.55.55.52`.
- `http://java-app-2.example.com/java-app-2/` should route to `172.55.55.53`.


#### Summary

- **Path-based routing** uses URL paths (like `/java-app-1/`) to direct traffic to the correct target group.
- **Host-based routing** uses hostnames (like `java-app-1.example.com`) to route traffic.
- Both methods leverage ALB rules for flexible, application-aware routing.

This setup allows granular control over how traffic flows to your backend services based on both path and host information.

# Handling HTTP 302 Redirect in Spring Boot

## Issue Overview

When testing a Spring Boot application deployed behind an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB), you might encounter an HTTP 302 response code. Let’s walk through the issue and how to fix it.

## Problem Statement

Consider the following Spring Boot application:


## Testing with `curl`
When running the application and testing the endpoint with `curl`:

```bash
curl -I http://18.132.41.147:8080/java-app-1
```

You receive a `302` redirect:

```
HTTP/1.1 302
Location: http://18.132.41.147:8080/java-app-1/
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Date: Sun, 23 Feb 2025 10:22:51 GMT
```

Following the redirect:

```bash
curl -I http://18.132.41.147:8080/java-app-1/
```

You get a `200 OK`:

```
HTTP/1.1 200
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 30
Date: Sun, 23 Feb 2025 10:22:54 GMT
```

## Why does this happen?
- In Spring Boot, a request to `/java-app-2` without a trailing slash triggers a **302 redirect** to `/java-app-2/`. This is default behavior, as Spring treats paths ending with `/` as directories.
- AWS ALB’s default health check uses the path you specify without adding a trailing slash, causing it to fail with 302 unless configured correctly.

## Solution
Update the ALB health check path to include the trailing slash:

1. Go to the AWS console.
2. Navigate to the target group attached to the ALB.
3. Edit the health check path:
   - **Old path:** `/java-app-2`
   - **New path:** `/java-app-2/`

Now, the health check will receive a `200 OK`, and the service will register as healthy.

## Conclusion
- The `302` happened because Spring Boot redirects non-slash-terminated URLs.
- Adjusting the ALB health check path fixed the issue.
- Always test both with and without the trailing slash to identify such subtle mismatches.

Would you like to expand this further with more examples or diagrams?

# Checklist for Developers

Here’s a checklist of what we need to make sure the health checks work properly with the ALB:

- Add a `/health` endpoint to the application.
- Ensure the `/health` endpoint returns a **200 OK** status when the application is healthy.
- Configure the **context path** correctly in `application.yaml` or `application.properties`.
- Test the **/health** endpoint both **locally** and in the **deployed environment**.
- Document the `/health` endpoint clearly in the application's **README** or **API documentation**.

Can you please make sure these points are covered? Let me know if there's anything blocking you or if the endpoint setup needs adjustments!

# Enabling HTTPS on ALB with ACM and Route 53

## Overview
This guide explains how to enable HTTPS for your Application Load Balancer (ALB) and set up HTTP to HTTPS redirection. You will:

1. Create an ACM certificate for your domain and subdomains.
2. Validate the certificate using Route 53 DNS records.
3. Add a new HTTPS listener (port 443) to your ALB.
4. Redirect HTTP traffic (port 80) to HTTPS (port 443).
5. Recreate path-based and host-based rules for the HTTPS listener.

---

## 1. Create an ACM Certificate

1. Go to **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)** in the AWS console.
2. Click **Request a certificate**.
3. Select **Request a public certificate**.
4. Enter the following domains:
   - `example.com` (for main domain)
   - `*.example.com` (to cover all subdomains like `java-app-1.example.com`, `java-app-2.example.com`, etc.)
5. Choose **DNS validation**.
6. Click **Request**.

---

## 2. Validate the Certificate with Route 53

1. Once the certificate request is created, ACM will show DNS records for validation.
2. Click **Create records in Route 53** — this will automatically add the required CNAME records to your hosted zone.
3. Wait for the validation to complete — the status should change from **Pending validation** to **Issued**.

---

## 3. Add HTTPS Listener (Port 443) to ALB

1. Go to **EC2** -> **Load Balancers**.
2. Select your ALB.
3. Under the **Listeners** tab, click **Add listener**.
4. Choose:
   - **Protocol:** HTTPS
   - **Port:** 443
5. Under **Default action**:
   - Select **Forward to** your default target group (you can adjust rules later).
6. Click **Add certificates** -> **Choose an existing certificate from ACM**.
7. Select the certificate you created.
8. Click **Add**.

---

## 4. Recreate Path-Based and Host-Based Rules for HTTPS Listener

When you create the **443 listener** (HTTPS), you must recreate the path-based and host-based rules since rules from the **80 listener** (HTTP) do not carry over automatically.

1. Go to **EC2** -> **Load Balancers**.
2. Select your ALB.
3. Under **Listeners**, find the newly created **HTTPS (443) listener**.
4. Click **View/edit rules**.
5. Recreate your existing rules from HTTP listener:
   - `/java-app-1/` → forward to target group 1
   - `/java-app-2/` → forward to target group 2
   - `java-app-1.example.com` → forward to target group 1
   - `java-app-2.example.com` → forward to target group 2
6. Click **Save**.

Now your HTTPS listener will handle secure traffic, applying the same routing logic as your HTTP listener.

---

## 5. Redirect HTTP to HTTPS

Since you already have HTTP (port 80) listener rules for path-based and host-based routing, you don't need to delete those rules. Instead, follow these steps:

### Add a redirect rule

1. Go to your ALB -> **Listeners** -> select the **HTTP:80 listener**.
2. Click **View/edit rules**.
3. **Add rule** at the top (above existing rules):
   - **If path is `*` (matches all requests)** → **Redirect to HTTPS (443)**.
   - **Port:** 443
   - **Status code:** 301 (Permanent Redirect)
4. Click **Save**.

This rule will catch all HTTP traffic and redirect it to HTTPS before any other path or host-based rule is applied.

> **Cleanup Step:** Once you've recreated all the path-based and host-based rules in the HTTPS (443) listener and added the redirect rule in the HTTP (80) listener, the existing path and host rules in the HTTP listener become irrelevant. At this point, you can safely delete them. The only rule needed in the HTTP listener is the `*` redirect-to-HTTPS rule.
---

## 6. Listener Rule Priorities

AWS ALB processes listener rules **in order of priority**:

- **Priority 1**: The redirect rule (`/* -> HTTPS`) should have the highest priority. This ensures all HTTP requests are caught and redirected to HTTPS before any other rules are evaluated.
- **Lower priorities**: Your path-based and host-based routing rules will have lower priorities (like 2, 3, etc.). These will only be processed after traffic has already been redirected to HTTPS.

**Key points:**
- Rules are evaluated in ascending order, starting from Priority 1.
- The first rule to match the request is applied — once a match is found, no further rules are processed.
- The HTTPS listener (port 443) will continue handling your path and host routing rules after the HTTP to HTTPS redirect is done.

---

## 7. Testing

Once setup is complete, test your applications:

- Access your apps via HTTP:
  - `http://example.com/java-app-1/` → should redirect to `https://example.com/java-app-1/`
  - `http://java-app-1.example.com/java-app-1/` → should redirect to `https://java-app-1.example.com/java-app-1/`
- Confirm HTTPS works directly:
  - `https://example.com/java-app-1/`
  - `https://java-app-1.example.com/java-app-1/`

Your load balancer will now handle secure HTTPS traffic and automatically redirect HTTP requests.

---

## Summary

- **ACM**: Generates the SSL certificate.
- **Route 53**: Validates the domain using DNS records.
- **ALB**: Has two listeners — one for HTTP (80) and one for HTTPS (443).
- **Redirect rule**: Ensures all HTTP traffic is forwarded to HTTPS.
- **Listener rule priorities**: The redirect rule has **Priority 1** to catch HTTP requests first.
- **Recreate rules**: Path-based and host-based rules must be manually added to the HTTPS listener.

This ensures secure and seamless access to your Java applications!
