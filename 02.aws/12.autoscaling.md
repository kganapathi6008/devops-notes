# High Availability and Fault Tolerance in AWS

## Achieving High Availability and Fault Tolerance

In AWS, to achieve high availability (HA) and fault tolerance (FT) for an application, we need to use a combination of services that ensure traffic is evenly distributed, and faulty instances are automatically replaced.

While the Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) routes traffic to healthy servers based on health checks, it does **NOT** recreate servers if they fail. Instead, ELB simply stops sending traffic to unhealthy instances.

To automatically recreate instances when they fail, we use **Auto Scaling** combined with ELB.

## What is Auto Scaling?

**Auto Scaling** is an AWS service that automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances in response to changing demand. It ensures that the application always has the right number of instances to handle the load.

### Benefits of Auto Scaling:

1. **High Availability:** Automatically replaces unhealthy instances and distributes instances across multiple Availability Zones.
2. **Fault Tolerance:** Detects and replaces failed instances to maintain application availability.
3. **Scalability:** Dynamically increases or decreases the number of instances based on demand.
4. **Cost Optimization:** Ensures you only run as many instances as needed, reducing costs during low-traffic periods.
5. **Elasticity:** Quickly adapts to spikes in traffic without manual intervention.

## Components of Auto Scaling

To implement auto scaling, the following components are required:

### 1. **Auto Scaling Group (ASG):**
- A logical group of EC2 instances managed by Auto Scaling.
- Defines the **minimum**, **maximum**, and **desired** number of instances.
- Automatically launches or terminates instances based on scaling policies.

**Key Configurations:**
- **Minimum Capacity:** The least number of instances the ASG should maintain at all times.
- **Maximum Capacity:** The most number of instances the ASG can scale up to.
- **Desired Capacity:** The number of instances the ASG tries to maintain (can dynamically adjust based on scaling policies).
- **Availability Zones:** Ensures instances are spread across multiple AZs for high availability.

### 2. **Launch Template or Launch Configuration:**
- Specifies how new EC2 instances are created.
- Includes details like:
  - AMI (Amazon Machine Image)
  - Instance type (e.g., t2.micro, m5.large)
  - Security groups
  - Key pairs for SSH
  - User data scripts (for initializing the instance)
- **Launch Templates** are the recommended way, offering versioning and more flexibility compared to **Launch Configurations**.

### 3. **Scaling Policies:**
- Rules that define when and how to scale the instances.
- **Types of Scaling Policies:**
  - **Target Tracking Scaling:** Adjusts instance count to maintain a metric target (e.g., keeping CPU utilization at 50%).
  - **Step Scaling:** Adds or removes instances in steps based on metric thresholds.
  - **Scheduled Scaling:** Scales at pre-defined times (e.g., adding instances every morning at 9 AM).

### 4. **CloudWatch Alarms:**
- **Amazon CloudWatch** monitors metrics and triggers scaling actions via alarms.
- An alarm watches a single metric (like CPU utilization, memory usage, or request count) and performs actions when the value exceeds or falls below a threshold.
- For example:
  - **Scale Out:** Add instances when CPU utilization exceeds 70%.
  - **Scale In:** Remove instances when CPU utilization drops below 30%.
- These alarms are linked to scaling policies to control how Auto Scaling responds to changing conditions.

### 5. **Health Checks:**
- Auto Scaling performs health checks to identify and replace unhealthy instances.
- Types of health checks:
  - **EC2 Health Checks:** Verifies if the instance is running.
  - **ELB Health Checks:** Ensures instances registered with the load balancer are healthy.

### 6. **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB):**
- Distributes incoming traffic across healthy instances.
- Works with ASG by automatically registering new instances and removing terminated ones.
- Ensures zero-downtime scaling.

## Example: Auto Scaling with ELB and CloudWatch Alarms

Letâ€™s walk through an example to better understand how these components work together.

### Scenario:
You have a web application running on EC2 instances. You want to:
- Maintain a minimum of 2 instances.
- Allow scaling up to a maximum of 6 instances.
- Start with a desired capacity of 3 instances.
- Add an instance if CPU usage exceeds 70% for 5 minutes.
- Remove an instance if CPU usage falls below 30% for 5 minutes.

### Steps:
1. **Create a Launch Template:** Define the AMI, instance type, and security groups.
2. **Configure an Auto Scaling Group (ASG):**
   - Minimum capacity: 2
   - Maximum capacity: 6
   - Desired capacity: 3
   - Attach the Launch Template
3. **Set up CloudWatch Alarms:**
   - **High CPU Alarm:** Triggers a scale-out action when CPU > 70%.
   - **Low CPU Alarm:** Triggers a scale-in action when CPU < 30%.
4. **Define Scaling Policies:**
   - Scale out: Add 1 instance when High CPU Alarm triggers.
   - Scale in: Remove 1 instance when Low CPU Alarm triggers.
5. **Attach the ASG to an ELB:** Ensure incoming traffic is distributed evenly across healthy instances.

### Flow:
- When CPU exceeds 70%, CloudWatch triggers the High CPU Alarm.
- The ASG adds an instance according to the scaling policy.
- ELB automatically registers the new instance and routes traffic to it.
- If CPU drops below 30%, CloudWatch triggers the Low CPU Alarm.
- The ASG terminates an instance, and ELB removes it from its target group.

## How Auto Scaling, ELB, and CloudWatch Work Together

1. **Traffic Routing:** ELB distributes traffic to instances in an ASG.
2. **Health Monitoring:** ELB checks instance health and stops routing to unhealthy ones.
3. **CloudWatch Monitoring:** Monitors CPU, memory, and other metrics.
4. **Alarms and Scaling:** CloudWatch Alarms trigger scaling actions based on thresholds.
5. **Instance Replacement:** ASG launches or terminates instances based on scaling policies.
6. **Dynamic Scaling:** The number of instances automatically adjusts, ensuring optimal performance and cost.

By combining **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)**, **Elastic Load Balancers (ELB)**, and **CloudWatch Alarms**, we can achieve high availability, fault tolerance, and dynamic scalability for our applications in AWS.
