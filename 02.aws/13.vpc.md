# Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

## What is a VPC?
- **VPC** stands for Virtual Private Cloud. It is a logically isolated network within the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources like EC2 instances, load balancers, and auto-scaling groups.
- When you create an AWS account, a **default VPC** is automatically created in each region. This default VPC allows instances to connect to the internet directly.

### Why do we need a VPC?

- **Isolation:** Ensures your resources are secure and not directly accessible from the internet.
- **Customization:** You control your IP ranges, subnets, route tables, and gateways.
- **Security:** Use security groups and network ACLs to control traffic.
- **Scalability:** Easily expand your network as your application grows.
- **Hybrid connectivity:** Connect your VPC to on-premises data centers using VPN or Direct Connect.

## VPC and CIDR Blocks
- When creating a VPC, you must specify an IP range using a **CIDR block** (Classless Inter-Domain Routing). This defines the range of IP addresses available for your resources.
- A **CIDR block** represents the IP range and the number of available IPs.


### CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)

- **CIDR block** defines the IP address range for your VPC.
- AWS allows you to specify an IPv4 CIDR block between **/16** and **/28**.
- **/16** means 65,536 IP addresses (largest allowed in VPC).
- **/28** means 16 IP addresses (smallest allowed in VPC).

### CIDR Block Range

A CIDR block is represented as:

```
10.0.0.0/16
```

- **10.0.0.0** is the network portion.
- **/16** means the first 16 bits are the network portion, leaving 16 bits for host addresses.

| CIDR Block | Number of IPs |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| /16        | 65,536        |
| /17        | 32,768        |
| /18        | 16,384        |
| /19        | 8,192         |
| /20        | 4,096         |
| /21        | 2,048         |
| /22        | 1,024         |
| /23        | 512           |
| /24        | 256           |
| /25        | 128           |
| /26        | 64            |
| /27        | 32            |
| /28        | 16            |

### How to calculate the number of IPs

Formula:

```
Number of IPs = 2^(32 - subnet mask)
```

For example:

- **/24**: 2^(32 - 24) = 2^8 = 256 IPs
- **/28**: 2^(32 - 28) = 2^4 = 16 IPs

### Examples of CIDR blocks:
- `10.0.0.0/16`: This allows **65,536 IP addresses** (from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.255.255).
- `10.0.0.0/24`: This allows **256 IP addresses** (from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.0.255).
- `192.168.0.0/28`: This allows **16 IP addresses** (from 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.0.15).


## Subnets
- A **subnet** is a smaller network within a VPC. It allows you to partition the VPC’s IP range.
- Subnets help organize and control access to resources.
- Each subnet must have a CIDR block that falls within the VPC’s CIDR range.
- You can create multiple subnets within a VPC.

### Types of Subnets:
1. **Public Subnets**
   - A subnet is public if it is associated with a route table that has a route to an Internet Gateway (IGW).
   - Resources in public subnets can communicate directly with the internet.
2. **Private Subnets**
   - A subnet is private if it is associated with a route table that has a route to an NAT Gateway (NGW).
   - Resources in private subnets cannot access the internet directly.

### Reserved IP Addresses:
AWS reserves **5 IP addresses** in each subnet's CIDR block:
- **.0**: Network address
- **.1**: VPC router
- **.2**: Reserved by AWS
- **.3**: Reserved by AWS for future use
- **.255**: Broadcast address (if applicable)

#### Example:
- If you have a **10.0.1.0/24** subnet (256 IPs), you will have **251 usable IP addresses**.

## Internet Gateway (IGW)
- An **Internet Gateway** allows resources in your VPC (like EC2 instances in public subnets) to access the internet.
- A subnet becomes **public** when its route table points to an IGW.
- The **default VPC** comes with an IGW already attached, allowing internet access by default.

## NAT Gateway
- A **NAT Gateway** enables instances in a **private subnet** to initiate outbound traffic to the internet, but it prevents incoming traffic from the internet.
- NAT Gateways must be created in a **public subnet**.
- Private subnets use a route to the NAT Gateway to access the internet indirectly.

## Route Tables
- A **route table** contains rules (routes) that determine how traffic is directed.
- Each subnet must be associated with a route table.
- A route table can direct traffic to:
  - An Internet Gateway (for public subnets)
  - A NAT Gateway (for private subnets)

## VPC Peering and CIDR Overlaps
- **VPC Peering** connects two VPCs, allowing them to communicate privately.
- **Limitations:**
  - You **cannot** have VPC peering if the VPCs have overlapping CIDR blocks.
  - Each VPC must have a unique CIDR range to establish peering.

### Can two VPCs have the same CIDR?
- **Yes**, we can have the same CIDR in the same region also. But the two VPCs cannot have the same CIDR if you want to set up VPC peering.
- Overlapping CIDRs cause routing conflicts, making VPC peering impossible.

                    Internet                        (Outbound Only)

```

### Route Tables Explanation:
- **Public Route Table:** Associated with public subnets. Contains routes like:
  - `0.0.0.0/0 -> IGW` (to allow internet access)
- **Private Route Table:** Associated with private subnets. Contains routes like:
  - `0.0.0.0/0 -> NAT Gateway` (for internet access via NAT)
  - Routes to other subnets for internal communication

Each subnet must be linked to a route table to control the traffic flow.

## Difference Between IGW and NAT Gateway

Let’s break down the difference between **Internet Gateway (IGW)** and **NAT Gateway (NGW)** — focusing on how traffic flows between the instances and the internet.

---

### 🌐 **Public Subnets (using IGW)**
- Instances in a **public subnet** have a **public IP** or **Elastic IP (EIP)**.
- The **Route Table** for public subnets contains a route like this:

```
0.0.0.0/0 -> IGW
```

**How it works:**
- **Outbound traffic**: The instance can directly access the internet.
- **Inbound traffic**: The instance can receive traffic directly from the internet (for example, SSH access or HTTP requests if running a web server).

✅ **Use case**: Public subnets are for resources that need to be accessed from the internet — load balancers, bastion hosts, etc.

---

### 🔒 **Private Subnets (using NAT Gateway)**
- Instances in a **private subnet** have only **private IPs** (no public IPs).
- The **Route Table** for private subnets contains a route like this:

```
0.0.0.0/0 -> NAT Gateway
```

**How it works:**
- **Outbound traffic**: The instance sends traffic to the NAT Gateway, which forwards it to the internet.
- **Inbound traffic**: The NAT Gateway **does not allow unsolicited inbound traffic** — only responses to requests initiated by the private instance are allowed.

✅ **Use case**: Private subnets are for instances that need to download updates, talk to external APIs, or send logs — but **should not be directly accessible from the internet**.

---

### 🔥 **Key Differences**
- **IGW** = **2-way traffic** (instances can send and receive traffic from the internet directly).
- **NAT Gateway** = **1-way traffic** (instances can send traffic to the internet, but the internet cannot directly reach those instances).

---

### **Example**
- **Public subnet** (using IGW): An EC2 instance with a public IP can host a website — users can access it directly.
- **Private subnet** (using NAT Gateway): An EC2 instance can pull software updates or send logs to S3, but no one can SSH or visit it directly from the internet.

       - Destination: `0.0.0.0/0`
       - Target: `Internet Gateway (IGW)`
     - Associate with **all public subnets**
   - **Private Route Table:**
     - Name: `PrivateRT`
     - Routes:
       - Destination: `0.0.0.0/0`
       - Target: `NAT Gateway (NGW)`
     - Associate with **all private subnets**

6. **Security Groups (SG):**

   - Create a security group named `MySG`
   - Inbound rules:
     - Allow HTTP (port 80)
     - Allow HTTPS (port 443)
     - Allow SSH (port 22)

7. **Network ACLs (NACL):**

   - Create a new NACL
   - Add rules for inbound and outbound traffic (stateless)

8. **DHCP Options Set:**

   - Define DNS servers (Amazon DNS: `AmazonProvidedDNS`)
   - Configure domain name (`ec2.internal`)

9. **Enable DNS:**

   - Enable **DNS hostnames** for public IP resolution.
   - Enable **DNS resolution** to use Amazon DNS.

## Best Practices for VPC

- **Subnet planning:**
  - Use `/24` subnets for easy IP management.
  - Separate public and private subnets.
- **Security:**
  - Use security groups for instance-level security.
  - Use NACLs for subnet-level rules.
- **High Availability:**
  - Spread subnets across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).
- **Routing:**
  - Ensure public subnets have routes to IGW.
  - Ensure private subnets have routes to NAT Gateway.
- **Monitoring:**
  - Use VPC Flow Logs to capture IP traffic.

## Conclusion

A VPC gives you full control over your cloud network, allowing you to build secure, scalable applications in AWS. Understanding CIDR, subnets, route tables, and security layers is crucial for creating robust architectures.

# Why Can't I Ping an EC2 Instance even after opening **All TCP (0-65535)** ?

## Scenario

I have two EC2 instances:

- **Instance A**: Located in a **public subnet**.
- **Instance B**: Located in a **private subnet**.

I want to **ping Instance B from Instance A**. However, the ping fails, even though I have opened **All TCP (0-65535)** for **Instance B** in its security group.

When I explicitly allow **ICMP (ping) traffic** in the security group of **Instance B**, the ping works.

## Explanation

In AWS, **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)** — the protocol used by ping — is separate from TCP and UDP. Here’s why the ping didn’t work initially:

1. **Security groups handle ICMP separately:**
   - Opening **All TCP (0-65535)** only applies to **TCP traffic**.
   - **ICMP traffic** (used for ping) is not covered under "All TCP" — it needs its own rule.

2. **How to allow ping (ICMP) traffic:**
   To allow **Instance A** to ping **Instance B**, you need to add a rule to the **inbound rules of Instance B's security group**:

   - **Type:** `All ICMP - IPv4`
   - **Protocol:** `ICMP`
   - **Port Range:** N/A (ICMP doesn’t use ports)
   - **Source:** Security group of Instance A, or a custom CIDR range like `10.0.0.0/16` (if both instances are in the same VPC)

## Why can't you just open "All TCP"?

- **All TCP** only applies to TCP traffic — it doesn’t cover other protocols like ICMP.
- To allow ping, you must explicitly allow **ICMP** traffic, as it operates outside the TCP/UDP model.

## Summary

To ping an EC2 instance in a private subnet from a public subnet:

- Ensure the **private instance's security group** allows **ICMP (ping)** traffic.
- Add an **inbound rule** for `All ICMP - IPv4`, tighten the source to only allow pings from trusted sources (like the security group of the public instance).

# AWS Security Concepts: Security Groups, NACLs, and WAF

## 1. Security Groups (SG)

**Definition:**
- Security Groups are virtual firewalls for EC2 instances that control inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level.
- They are **stateful**, meaning if an inbound rule allows traffic, the outbound response is automatically allowed.

**Real-world example:**
Imagine you work in a **corporate building** where each **company office** (representing EC2 instances) has its own security guard (Security Group). The security guard checks who can enter and exit.

- **Inbound rule:** Allows employees (traffic) to enter the office.
- **Outbound rule:** Automatically lets them leave once they're inside — you don't need a separate rule.

**Key points:**
- Applies to individual instances.
- Only allows explicitly defined traffic.
- Default behavior: **all inbound traffic is denied, all outbound traffic is allowed.**

**Example:**
A Security Group for a web server might have:
- **Inbound rules:**
  - HTTP (port 80) from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)
  - HTTPS (port 443) from anywhere
  - SSH (port 22) from your IP only (e.g., 203.0.113.25/32)
- **Outbound rules:**
  - Allow all outbound traffic (0.0.0.0/0)

---

## 2. Network Access Control Lists (NACL)

**Definition:**
- NACLs are stateless firewalls that control traffic at the **subnet level**.
- They check both **inbound and outbound rules separately** — an inbound rule doesn’t automatically allow the response outbound.

**Real-world example:**
Think of the **main entrance to the corporate building** (NACL) where a security checkpoint controls who can enter and leave the entire building. This checkpoint doesn’t remember who entered, so even if someone was allowed in, they need explicit permission to leave.

- **Inbound rule:** Controls who can enter the building (subnet).
- **Outbound rule:** Controls who can leave the building.

**Key points:**
- Applies to subnets (affecting all instances in that subnet).
- Stateless — inbound and outbound rules are independent.
- Default NACL: **Allows all inbound and outbound traffic.**
- Custom NACL: **Denies all inbound and outbound traffic until rules are added.**

**Example:**
A NACL for a public subnet might have:
- **Inbound rules:**
  - Allow HTTP (port 80) from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)
  - Allow HTTPS (port 443) from anywhere
  - Allow SSH (port 22) from your IP only
- **Outbound rules:**
  - Allow all traffic (0.0.0.0/0)

---

## 3. Web Application Firewall (WAF)

**Definition:**
- AWS WAF protects web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP/HTTPS requests based on rules you define.
- It helps block common attack patterns like **SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS),** or **DDoS attacks**.

**Real-world example:**
Consider the **reception desk inside each company’s office** (WAF) — even after passing through the building entrance (NACL) and office security (SG), the receptionist checks if visitors follow office rules (like not carrying harmful materials). They might block certain behaviors or restrict access to specific rooms.

**Key points:**
- Applied at the **application layer** (Layer 7 of the OSI model).
- Protects web apps hosted on CloudFront, ALB, or API Gateway.
- Can filter traffic based on IP, headers, URI strings, etc.

**Example rules:**
- Block IP addresses from a malicious source.
- Allow requests only from a specific country.
- Block requests containing SQL injection patterns.

---

## Differences Between SG, NACL, and WAF

| Feature                  | Security Group (SG) | NACL                      | WAF                  |
|--------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Level of control         | Instance level     | Subnet level              | Application level    |
| Stateful/Stateless       | Stateful           | Stateless                 | Stateful             |
| Inbound/Outbound rules   | Automatically allows outbound response | Need explicit rules for both directions | Controls HTTP/HTTPS traffic |
| Default behavior         | Inbound denied, outbound allowed | All traffic allowed (default NACL) | No rules by default          |
| Use case                 | Instance firewall  | Subnet-level traffic control | Protect web apps     |

---

## When to Use Each

- **Use Security Groups** when you want to control traffic **to and from individual instances** — like allowing web server access (HTTP, HTTPS).
- **Use NACLs** when you want to secure entire **subnets** — like blocking all SSH traffic to a private subnet.
- **Use WAF** to protect **web applications** from malicious HTTP/HTTPS requests — like preventing SQL injection or rate limiting API requests.

# VPC Peering in AWS

## What is VPC Peering?

**VPC Peering** is a networking connection between two VPCs that allows instances in either VPC to communicate with each other as if they are within the same network.
- It is a **direct network connection** — data doesn't pass through the internet.
- VPC peering can be set up between VPCs in the same AWS account or across different accounts.
- Peered VPCs must have non-overlapping CIDR blocks.

---

## Scenario

You have two VPCs:

- **VPC A:** `10.0.0.0/16`
- **VPC B:** `192.0.0.0/16`

Each VPC contains an **EC2 instance** in a **private subnet**, and you want to enable communication between the two instances using VPC peering.

---

## Steps to Create a VPC Peering Connection

### 1. **Create the VPC Peering Connection**

1. Go to the **VPC Dashboard** in AWS.
2. Select **Peering Connections** → **Create Peering Connection**.
3. Provide the following details:
   - **Name tag:** `VPC-A-to-VPC-B`
   - **Requester VPC:** `VPC A (10.0.0.0/16)`
   - **Accepter VPC:** `VPC B (192.0.0.0/16)`
4. Click **Create Peering Connection**.

### 2. **Accept the Peering Request**

1. Go to **Peering Connections**.
2. Select the newly created peering connection.
3. Click **Actions** → **Accept Request**.
4. The status should change to **Active**.

### 3. **Update Route Tables**

You need to add routes in both VPCs' route tables to direct traffic through the peering connection.

#### **In VPC A (10.0.0.0/16):**

1. Go to **Route Tables** in the VPC Dashboard.
2. Select the route table associated with the **private subnet**.
3. Click **Edit Routes** → **Add Route**.
4. Add the following:
   - **Destination:** `192.0.0.0/16`
   - **Target:** Peering connection ID (`pcx-xxxxxx`)
5. Save the route.

#### **In VPC B (192.0.0.0/16):**

1. Select the route table for the **private subnet**.
2. Click **Edit Routes** → **Add Route**.
3. Add the following:
   - **Destination:** `10.0.0.0/16`
   - **Target:** Peering connection ID (`pcx-xxxxxx`)
4. Save the route.

### 4. **Modify Security Groups**

Ensure both instances' security groups allow traffic from the other VPC:

- **Instance in VPC A:**
  - **Inbound Rule:**
    - Type: **All Traffic** (or restrict to specific ports like TCP/ICMP)
    - Source: `192.0.0.0/16`

- **Instance in VPC B:**
  - **Inbound Rule:**
    - Type: **All Traffic**
    - Source: `10.0.0.0/16`

### 5. **Test Connectivity**

1. SSH into the instance in **VPC A**.
2. Try to ping the private IP of the instance in **VPC B**:
   ```bash
   ping <private-IP-of-instance-in-VPC-B>
   ```
3. Repeat the test from **VPC B** to **VPC A**.

If you've configured everything correctly, you should see successful pings between the two instances.

---

## Important Considerations

- **DNS Resolution:** Enable **DNS hostnames and resolution** if you want to use private DNS names to communicate.
  - Go to **VPC settings** → **Enable DNS resolution**.
- **Transitive Peering:** VPC peering is **non-transitive** — if VPC A is peered with VPC B, and B is peered with C, A cannot communicate with C unless you create a direct peering connection.
- **Cross-Region Peering:** To peer VPCs across regions, ensure you use the correct region-specific peering options.

---
