# EC2 Basics

## What is Amazon EC2?
- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in the AWS cloud.
- Reduces the need to invest in hardware upfront.
- Allows quick scaling of applications.

## Key EC2 Concepts
- **Instances**: Virtual servers in AWS.
- **AMI (Amazon Machine Image)**: Pre-configured templates for instances.
- **Instance Types**: Various configurations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking.
- **Security Groups**: Virtual firewalls controlling inbound and outbound traffic.
- **Key Pairs**: SSH authentication for secure access.
- **Elastic IP**: Static IP addresses for EC2 instances.
- **EBS (Elastic Block Store)**: Persistent storage volumes for EC2.
- **User Data**: Scripts executed on instance launch for automation.

## EC2 Instance Creation and Configuration

### 1. Launching an Amazon Linux EC2 Instance with HTTPD Installed

#### Steps:
1. Open AWS Management Console and navigate to EC2.
2. Click on **Launch Instance**.
3. Choose **Amazon Linux 2** as the AMI.
4. Select an appropriate instance type (e.g., **t2.micro** for free tier eligibility).
5. Configure instance details (default settings are fine for now).
6. Add storage (default 8GB EBS is sufficient).
7. Configure security group:
   - Allow **HTTP (port 80)** and **SSH (port 22)**.
8. Add key pair for SSH access.
9. In the **Advanced Details** section, enter the following bootstrap script in **User Data**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
echo "<h1>Amazon Linux EC2 with Apache</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
```

10. Launch the instance and access the public IP via **http://PUBLIC_IP**.

### 2. Launching an Ubuntu EC2 Instance with Nginx Installed

#### Steps:
1. Follow the same steps as above but choose **Ubuntu 22.04** as the AMI.
2. Configure security group:
   - Allow **HTTP (port 80)** and **SSH (port 22)**.
3. Use the following bootstrap script in **User Data**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
apt update -y
apt install -y nginx
systemctl start nginx
systemctl enable nginx
echo "<h1>Ubuntu EC2 with Nginx</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
```

4. Launch the instance and access the public IP via **http://PUBLIC_IP**.
