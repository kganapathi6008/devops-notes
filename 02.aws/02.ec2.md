# EC2 Basics

## What is Amazon EC2?
- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in the AWS cloud.
- Reduces the need to invest in hardware upfront.
- Allows quick scaling of applications.

## Key EC2 Concepts
- **Instances**: Virtual servers in AWS.
- **AMI (Amazon Machine Image)**: Pre-configured templates for instances.
- **Instance Types**: Various configurations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking.
- **Security Groups**: Virtual firewalls controlling inbound and outbound traffic.
- **Key Pairs**: SSH authentication for secure access.
- **Elastic IP**: Static IP addresses for EC2 instances.
- **EBS (Elastic Block Store)**: Persistent storage volumes for EC2.
- **User Data**: Scripts executed on instance launch for automation.

## EC2 Instance Creation and Configuration

### 1. Launching an Amazon Linux EC2 Instance with HTTPD Installed

#### Steps:
1. Open AWS Management Console and navigate to EC2.
2. Click on **Launch Instance**.
3. Choose **Amazon Linux 2** as the AMI.
4. Select an appropriate instance type (e.g., **t2.micro** for free tier eligibility).
5. Configure instance details (default settings are fine for now).
6. Add storage (default 8GB EBS is sufficient).
7. Configure security group:
   - Allow **HTTP (port 80)** and **SSH (port 22)**.
8. Add key pair for SSH access.
9. In the **Advanced Details** section, enter the following bootstrap script in **User Data**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
echo "<h1>Amazon Linux EC2 with Apache</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
```
10. Launch the instance and access the public IP via **http://PUBLIC_IP**.

### 2. Launching an Ubuntu EC2 Instance with Nginx Installed

#### Steps:
1. Follow the same steps as above but choose **Ubuntu 22.04** as the AMI.
2. Configure security group:
   - Allow **HTTP (port 80)** and **SSH (port 22)**.
3. Use the following bootstrap script in **User Data**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
apt update -y
apt install -y nginx
systemctl start nginx
systemctl enable nginx
echo "<h1>Ubuntu EC2 with Nginx</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
```

4. Launch the instance and access the public IP via **http://PUBLIC_IP**.

# EC2 Instance Networking and Elastic IPs Explained

## Hostname and IP Address

### IP Address
- An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to a device on a network.
- It can be either public (accessible from the internet) or private (used within a local network).

### Hostname
- A hostname is a human-readable label assigned to a device on a network.
- It can be mapped to an IP address using DNS (Domain Name System).

## Public and Private IPs

### Public IP
- A public IP address is accessible over the internet.
- It is assigned to your EC2 instance when you launch it in a public subnet.
- It allows you to connect to your instance from anywhere over the internet.

### Private IP
- A private IP address is used for communication within the AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
- It is not accessible from the internet, only from other instances within the same VPC or connected networks.

## Public and Private DNS

### Public IPv4 DNS
- A public DNS is a hostname that resolves to the public IP address.
- It allows you to connect to your instance using a human-readable name instead of an IP address.

### Private IPv4 DNS
- A private DNS is a hostname that resolves to the private IP address.
- It is used for internal communication within the VPC.

## Connecting to EC2 Instance

### SSH Connection
```bash
ssh -i <pem-file> ec2-user@<public-ip>
```
- This works because the public IP is accessible over the internet.

```bash
ssh -i <pem-file> ec2-user@<private-ip>
```
- This does **not** work because the private IP is not accessible over the internet; it is only reachable within the VPC.

## Required Ports
| Protocol | Port | Purpose |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| SSH         | 22     | Remote login to EC2 instance |
| HTTP     | 80     | Accessing web server (optional) |
| HTTPS   | 443   | Secure web server access (optional) |

- These ports should be opened in the Security Group associated with the EC2 instance.

## Public IP Changes on Restart
- When you stop and start an EC2 instance, the public IP address changes.
- The private IP address remains the same.

## Elastic IP (Static Public IP)
### What is Elastic IP?
- Elastic IP is a static, public IPv4 address you can allocate and associate with your EC2 instance.
- This ensures your instance retains the same public IP even if it is stopped and started.

### How to Allocate and Assign Elastic IP
1. Open AWS EC2 Console.
2. Go to **Elastic IPs** from the left panel.
3. Click **Allocate Elastic IP Address**.
4. After allocation, select the Elastic IP, click **Actions** -> **Associate Elastic IP Address**.
5. Choose your EC2 instance and its private IP.
6. Click **Associate**.

### After Assigning Elastic IP
- The public IP remains the same even if you stop and start the EC2 instance.
- The Elastic IP replaces the default public IP.

## Elastic IP Charges
| Usage Status | Charges |
|-----------------|----------|
| Allocated and Associated | **Free** (up to 1 per instance) |
| Allocated but Not Associated | **Chargeable** (per hour) |

- AWS charges you if an Elastic IP is allocated but **not in use** (not associated with any running instance).
- If you release the Elastic IP, you will not be charged.

## Summary
- Public IP allows internet access; Private IP is for internal VPC communication.
- Public IPv4 DNS maps to the public IP; Private IPv4 DNS maps to the private IP.
- Restarting an EC2 instance changes the public IP.
- Use Elastic IP for a static public IP.
- Elastic IP is free if associated; charges apply if not associated.

Always remember to release unused Elastic IPs to avoid charges.
