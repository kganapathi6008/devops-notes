# AWS Notes

## 1. Why Cloud?
- **What AWS Services Provide?**
  - Compute (EC2, Lambda)
  - Storage (S3, EBS, EFS)
  - Database (RDS, DynamoDB, Aurora)
  - Networking (VPC, Route 53, CloudFront)
  - Security & Identity (IAM, KMS, Shield)
  - Management & Monitoring (CloudWatch, CloudTrail, Config)

- **Why Use Cloud?**
  - Cost-efficient (Pay-as-you-go pricing)
  - Scalability & Elasticity
  - High Availability & Fault Tolerance
  - Security & Compliance
  - Global Reach with Low Latency

## 2. Business Requirements
### High Availability (HA)
- Ensures systems remain available and accessible at all times.
- Prevents single points of failure.
- AWS services supporting HA: **Auto Scaling, Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), Multi-AZ Deployments**.

### Fault Tolerance (FT)
- Ability of a system to withstand component failures and continue operating.
- Example: If a web server fails, a backup server takes over immediately.
- AWS services supporting FT: **RDS Multi-AZ, S3 Cross-Region Replication, AWS Backup**.

### Scalability
- Ability to handle increasing workloads by adding resources (scaling out) or upgrading existing resources (scaling up).
- AWS services supporting scalability: **EC2 Auto Scaling, RDS Read Replicas, DynamoDB Auto Scaling**.

### Elasticity
- Dynamically grows or shrinks infrastructure resources to meet demand.
- AWS services supporting elasticity: **Lambda, Auto Scaling Groups, Elastic Beanstalk**.

## 3. What is Cloud Service?
- A cloud service is any service made available to users on demand via the Internet from a cloud computing provider’s servers.

### What is Cloud Computing?
- Delivery of computing services like **servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics** over the Internet.

## 4. Cloud Service Models
- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** - Provides virtualized computing resources (e.g., EC2, S3, VPC).
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** - Provides a platform to develop, run, and manage applications (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda).
- **Software as a Service (SaaS)** - Provides software applications over the Internet (e.g., Gmail, Office 365, AWS WorkSpaces).

## 5. AWS Global Infrastructure
- AWS provides a globally distributed infrastructure to ensure reliability, low latency, and compliance.

## 6. Regions & Availability Zones
- **Region:** A separate geographical area containing multiple data centers.
- **Availability Zone (AZ):** A physical data center within a region.

## 7. Key Concepts
### High Availability & Continuity
- Ensures minimal downtime and service interruptions.
- Achieved through redundancy and failover mechanisms.

### Latency Considerations
- The time taken for data to travel between users and AWS services.
- Lower latency improves performance and user experience.

### Data Residency
- Determines where data is stored to comply with regulations.

### Elasticity & Expansion
- Adapting infrastructure dynamically based on demand.

## 8. How to Choose the Right AWS Region
- Factors to consider:
  - **Latency** – Choose the nearest region.
  - **Compliance & Data Residency** – Some regions adhere to specific legal requirements.
  - **Service Availability** – Not all AWS services are available in every region.
  - **Cost** – Pricing varies by region.

## 9. EC2 Basics
- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) provides scalable virtual servers in the cloud.
- Used for hosting applications, websites, databases, and more.

## 10. Understanding EC2 Conceptually
- **Traditional Computing vs. EC2:**
  - CPU → vCPU (Virtual CPU)
  - RAM → Memory (GBs)
  - Hard Drive → EBS Volumes
  - Network Card → Virtual Network Interface
  - Firewall → Security Groups

## 11. EC2 Instance Purchase Options
- **On-Demand Instances** – Pay per hour with no long-term commitment.
- **Reserved Instances** – Commit to a specific instance for 1 or 3 years at a discount.
- **Spot Instances** – Bid for spare AWS capacity at lower prices.
- **Dedicated Hosts** – Physical servers dedicated to your use.
- **Savings Plans** – Flexible pricing model offering discounts.

## 12. Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
- A pre-configured template that contains the OS and application configuration.
- Can be customized and shared across AWS accounts.

## 13. EC2 Instance Types
- **General Purpose** – Balanced compute, memory, and networking (e.g., t3, m5).
- **Compute Optimized** – High performance for compute-heavy applications (e.g., c5, c6g).
- **Memory Optimized** – Optimized for large datasets (e.g., r5, x1e).
- **Storage Optimized** – High-performance storage for big data (e.g., i3, d2).
- **Accelerated Computing** – GPUs and FPGAs for machine learning and graphics (e.g., p4, g4ad).
