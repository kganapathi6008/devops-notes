# Configuring AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB) to Route Traffic to Multiple Targets

## Scenario 1: Routing Traffic to Two EC2 Instances
We have two EC2 instances running the same application:
- **Instance 1**: `172.55.55.51:80`
- **Instance 2**: `172.55.55.52:80`

To set up a Network Load Balancer (NLB) to distribute traffic between these two instances, follow these steps:

### **Step 1: Create a Network Load Balancer**
1. Navigate to the **AWS Management Console**.
2. Go to the **EC2 Dashboard** > **Load Balancers**.
3. Click **Create Load Balancer** and choose **Network Load Balancer**.
4. Set the **scheme**:
   - Choose **Internet-facing** if users access it from the internet.
   - Choose **Internal** if it's only accessible within a VPC.
5. Select a **VPC** and at least **two availability zones** for high availability.
6. Configure the **listener**:
   - Protocol: **TCP**
   - Port: **80**

### **Step 2: Create a Target Group**
1. Navigate to **Target Groups**.
2. Click **Create Target Group**.
3. Select **Target Type** as **Instances**.
4. Set Protocol: **TCP**, Port: **80**.
5. Select the appropriate **VPC**.
6. Register the targets:
   - Add `172.55.55.51` and `172.55.55.52` to the target group.
7. Click **Create Target Group**.

### **Step 3: Attach the Target Group to the NLB**
1. Go back to the **Network Load Balancer** configuration.
2. Under **Listeners**, choose the previously created **target group**.
3. Click **Create Load Balancer**.

Now, any request coming to the NLB's DNS will be distributed between `172.55.55.51:80` and `172.55.55.52:80`.

## Scenario 2: Adding Another Application on a Different Port
We have another instance running on:
- **Instance 3**: `172.55.55.53:8080`

To attach it to the **same NLB**, follow these steps:

1. Create another **Target Group** for port `8080`.
2. Register **`172.55.55.53`** in this target group.
3. Add a new **Listener** to the NLB:
   - Protocol: **TCP**
   - Port: **8080**
   - Forward to the **new target group**.

Now, the NLB will handle traffic for:
- Port **80**: Routes to `172.55.55.51` and `172.55.55.52`
- Port **8080**: Routes to `172.55.55.53`

---

## Scenario 3: Routing Traffic Based on Application Context
We have:
- `172.55.55.51:80/java-application-1`
- `172.55.55.52:80/java-application-1`
- `172.55.55.53:8080/java-application-2`

### **Can We Achieve This Using NLB?**
No, **NLB cannot route traffic based on paths (URL paths like `/java-application-1`)** because it operates at **Layer 4 (TCP/UDP level)**.

### **Achieving This Using Two NLBs**
If we create:
- **NLB 1**: Handles traffic for `172.55.55.51:80` and `172.55.55.52:80`.
- **NLB 2**: Handles traffic for `172.55.55.53:8080`.

This will work because each NLB only considers **IP and port**, not URL paths.

### **Why One NLB Cannot Achieve This?**
A **single NLB cannot differentiate between application contexts (`/java-application-1` or `/java-application-2`)** because it only routes based on **IP and port**.

### **Solution Using an Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
If routing based on URL paths is required, an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** should be used instead of NLB:
1. Create an **ALB**.
2. Set up **Listeners** on **port 80** and **port 8080**.
3. Create **Target Groups**:
   - One for `172.55.55.51` and `172.55.55.52` for **/java-application-1**.
   - One for `172.55.55.53` for **/java-application-2**.
4. Configure **Listener Rules** to forward requests based on URL paths:
   - Requests to `/java-application-1` → Forward to the first target group.
   - Requests to `/java-application-2` → Forward to the second target group.

This ensures requests are routed correctly based on the application context.

## Additional Considerations for NLB
### **Cross-Zone Load Balancing**
- By default, NLB distributes traffic to targets within the same **Availability Zone**.
- Enabling **Cross-Zone Load Balancing** ensures traffic is evenly distributed across all targets, regardless of the AZ.
- This is useful for applications that need **better load distribution** across multiple zones.

### **Health Checks**
- Ensure **health checks** are configured on each **Target Group**.
- If an instance becomes unhealthy, NLB stops routing traffic to it until it recovers.

### **IP-Based Targeting**
- Instead of targeting EC2 instances directly, you can register **IP addresses**.
- Useful for **ECS services** or targets outside the AWS environment.

### **Private Link Support**
- NLB supports **AWS PrivateLink**, allowing secure access to applications without exposing them to the internet.

---

## **Conclusion**
- **NLB is best for load balancing at the transport layer (Layer 4) and does not support routing based on URL paths.**
- **For routing based on URL paths, use an Application Load Balancer (ALB) instead.**
- **If different applications run on different ports, multiple NLBs can be used to handle them separately.**
- **Cross-zone load balancing, health checks, and private link support can optimize performance and security.**
