# Accessing EC2 Instance After Losing PEM Key

If you lose your `.pem` key file for an EC2 instance, here are several ways to regain access:

## Option 1: Create a New Key Pair and Replace the Public Key

1. Create a new key pair in the AWS console and download the new `.pem` file.

2. Use EC2 Instance Connect (for Amazon Linux or Ubuntu) or Systems Manager Session Manager to access the instance.

3. Generate the public key from the private key in your local machine (optional, if you only have a private key file):

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -y -f new-key.pem
   ```

   This will display the public key, which you can copy.

4. Replace the public key in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the instance:

   ```bash
   nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ```

   Copy and paste the new public key into this file, replacing the old key.

5. Save the file and exit. You can now use the new private key to SSH into the instance:

   ```bash
   ssh -i new-key.pem ec2-user@<ec2-public-ip>
   ```

## Option 2: Generate a New Key Pair on the Instance

1. Use EC2 Instance Connect or Session Manager to SSH into your instance.

2. Generate a new SSH key pair on the instance:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f my-ec2-key
   ```

   This will create:

   - `my-ec2-key` → Private key
   - `my-ec2-key.pub` → Public key

3. Add the new public key to `authorized_keys`:

   ```bash
   cat my-ec2-key.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ```

4. Download the private key `my-ec2-key` to your local machine using `scp` or by copying the contents:

   ```bash
   scp -i existing-key.pem ec2-user@<ec2-public-ip>:~/my-ec2-key .
   ```

5. SSH into the instance using the new private key:

   ```bash
   ssh -i my-ec2-key ec2-user@<ec2-public-ip>
   ```

## Option 3: Mount Root Volume to Another EC2 Instance

If EC2 Instance Connect is not available, follow these steps:

1. Stop your EC2 instance from the AWS console.
2. Detach the Root Volume from the instance (EC2 > Volumes > Detach Volume).
3. Attach the Volume to a Temporary EC2 Instance as a secondary volume.
4. SSH into the Temporary Instance.
5. Identify the filesystem type of the attached volume:

   ```bash
   lsblk -f
   ```

   Example Output:

   ```
   NAME      FSTYPE FSVER LABEL UUID                                 FSAVAIL FSUSE% MOUNTPOINTS
   xvda
   ├─xvda1   xfs          /     a9e4eaa3-237d-4fcf-89d0-36bb6d605103    6.4G    20% /
   ├─xvda127
   └─xvda128 vfat   FAT16       3CB4-73DB                               8.7M    13% /boot/efi
   xvdf
   ├─xvdf1   xfs          /     a9e4eaa3-237d-4fcf-89d0-36bb6d605103
   ├─xvdf127
   └─xvdf128 vfat   FAT16       3CB4-73DB
   ```

   This output shows that the secondary volume is `/dev/xvdf1` with `xfs` as the filesystem.

6. Mount the attached volume based on its filesystem type. If it is XFS, use the `nouuid` option:

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /mnt/recovery
   sudo mount -o nouuid -t xfs /dev/xvdf1 /mnt/recovery
   ```

   Example Output After Successful Mount:

   ```
   NAME      FSTYPE FSVER LABEL UUID                                 FSAVAIL FSUSE% MOUNTPOINTS
   xvda
   ├─xvda1   xfs          /     a9e4eaa3-237d-4fcf-89d0-36bb6d605103    6.4G    20% /
   ├─xvda127
   └─xvda128 vfat   FAT16       3CB4-73DB                               8.7M    13% /boot/efi
   xvdf
   ├─xvdf1   xfs          /     a9e4eaa3-237d-4fcf-89d0-36bb6d605103    6.4G    20% /mnt/recovery
   ├─xvdf127
   └─xvdf128 vfat   FAT16       3CB4-73DB
   ```

7. Navigate to the .ssh directory of the original instance:

   ```bash
   cd /mnt/recovery/home/ec2-user/.ssh
   ```

8. Update the authorized_keys File:

   Open the authorized_keys file:

   ```bash
   nano authorized_keys
   ```

   Replace the old key or add the new public key generated earlier:

   ```bash
   ssh-rsa AAAAB3...your_public_key_here... user@hostname
   ```

   Save and close the file.

9. Ensure permissions are set correctly:

   ```bash
   cd /mnt/recovery/home/ec2-user/
   chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys
   chmod 700 .ssh/
   ```

10. Unmount the volume from the temporary instance:

    ```bash
    cd ~        ## back to the current working directory
    sudo umount /mnt/recovery
    ```

11. Detach the volume from the temporary instance.
12. Reattach the volume to the original instance as the root volume (/dev/xvda).
13. Start the original EC2 instance.
14. SSH into Your EC2 Instance with the New Key:

    ```bash
    ssh -i new-key.pem ec2-user@<your-ec2-public-ip>
    ```

## Option 4: Enable Password Access Temporarily

If you prefer to enable password-based login temporarily:

1. SSH into your instance using EC2 Instance Connect or Session Manager.

2. Create a new user with a password:

   ```bash
   sudo adduser tempuser
   sudo passwd tempuser
   ```

3. Add user to sudo group:

   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG wheel tempuser # Amazon Linux
   sudo usermod -aG sudo tempuser  # Ubuntu
   ```

4. Enable password authentication in SSH config:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   ```

   - Set `PasswordAuthentication yes`.

5. Restart SSH service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart sshd
   ```

6. SSH into the instance with the password:

   ```bash
   ssh tempuser@<ec2-public-ip>
   ```

## Can You Generate a Private Key from a Public Key?
**No, you cannot generate a private key from a public key.**

This is because SSH keys use asymmetric encryption (like RSA or ED25519). The private key is like a secret, and the public key is derived from it using a one-way cryptographic process. This is why:

- You can generate a public key from a private key (using `ssh-keygen -y -f key.pem`).
- But you cannot generate a private key from a public key. The process is designed to be one-way for security.

### Why This Matters in Your Case
If you’ve connected to your EC2 instance using EC2 Instance Connect, AWS is using a temporary key to authenticate you. You don’t automatically have the private key corresponding to the public key in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

However, you do have access to the instance. So, you can:

- Add your new public key (from a new private key) to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

Or:

- Generate a fresh key pair on the instance and download the private key to your local machine:
    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f my-ec2-key
    ```
    - `my-ec2-key` → Private key
    - `my-ec2-key.pub` → Public key

- Add the public key to `authorized_keys`:
    ```bash
    cat my-ec2-key.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```
- Download the private key (`my-ec2-key`) to your local machine using `scp` or copy-pasting.

Use this private key for SSH access:
```bash
ssh -i my-ec2-key ec2-user@<ec2-public-ip>
```

---

## Best Practices
- **Always back up your private key safely.**
- **Enable Session Manager (SSM)** to avoid key dependency in the future.

---

## Troubleshooting
- Check file permissions for `authorized_keys` and `.ssh`.
- Ensure the correct user is used (e.g., `ec2-user`, `ubuntu`).
