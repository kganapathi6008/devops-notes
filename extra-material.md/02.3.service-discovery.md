# Advanced Docker Networking: Service Discovery, Load Balancing, and Ingress

## 1. Service Discovery

In a multi-container setup, especially with Docker Swarm or Kubernetes, service discovery is crucial for enabling containers to find and communicate with each other without relying on static IPs.

### Docker's Native Service Discovery

- Docker automatically assigns each container a hostname matching its name.
- Containers in the **same custom bridge network** can resolve each other by container names.

#### Example:
Create a custom network and two containers:
```bash
# Create a custom bridge network
docker network create my_custom_network

# Run two containers in the custom network
docker run -d --name app1 --network my_custom_network nginx
docker run -d --name app2 --network my_custom_network busybox sleep 3600
```

Now, from `app2`, you can ping `app1` by its name:
```bash
docker exec -it app2 ping app1
```

### DNS-Based Service Discovery
- Docker uses an embedded DNS server to resolve container names.
- The DNS server is active when you use user-defined networks.

### Docker Swarm Service Discovery
When running in **Swarm mode**:
- Services are automatically assigned a **Virtual IP (VIP)**.
- Containers can use service names instead of IPs.

#### Example (Docker Swarm):
```bash
# Initialize Docker Swarm
docker swarm init

# Create an overlay network
docker network create --driver overlay my_overlay_network

# Deploy a service
docker service create --name my_web --network my_overlay_network -p 8080:80 nginx
```
Containers in the same overlay network can access the `my_web` service by name.

## 2. Load Balancing

Load balancing ensures incoming traffic is distributed across multiple containers or services.

### Docker Swarm Load Balancing
- Docker Swarm includes built-in load balancing.
- Each service gets a VIP, and Docker routes traffic evenly across replicas.

#### Example:
Create a replicated service with load balancing:
```bash
# Create a replicated service
docker service create --name web --replicas 3 --publish 8080:80 nginx
```
- Traffic sent to port 8080 is load-balanced between the 3 Nginx containers.

### NGINX as a Reverse Proxy
For non-Swarm environments, you can use NGINX as a load balancer.

#### Example:
1. Run 2 Nginx containers:
```bash
docker network create my_network
docker run -d --name nginx1 --network my_network nginx
docker run -d --name nginx2 --network my_network nginx
```
2. Create an NGINX config (`nginx.conf`):
```nginx
http {
    upstream myapp {
        server nginx1:80;
        server nginx2:80;
    }

    server {
        listen 8080;
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://myapp;
        }
    }
}
```
3. Run the load balancer container:
```bash
docker run -d --name lb -p 8080:8080 --network my_network -v $(pwd)/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf nginx
```
Now access `http://localhost:8080`, and traffic will be distributed between `nginx1` and `nginx2`.

---

## 3. Ingress Networking

Ingress networking exposes services to the outside world.

### Docker Swarm Ingress
- When you publish a port in Docker Swarm, it automatically creates an **Ingress network**.
- The ingress network routes traffic from the host to the correct service.

#### Example:
Expose a service on port 80:
```bash
docker service create --name my_web --publish 80:80 nginx
```
Access it at `http://<node-ip>:80`.

### NGINX Ingress Controller (Advanced)
In Kubernetes or advanced Docker setups, an **Ingress Controller** (like NGINX) can manage routing rules.

#### Example:
Define routing rules in an NGINX Ingress config:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: example.local
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: my_web
            port:
              number: 80
```
This lets you route based on hostnames (e.g., `example.local`).
